        "Wordfish is a computer program written in the **R statistical language** to extract political positions from text documents. Word frequencies are used to place documents onto a single dimension. Wordfish is a scaling technique and does not need any anchoring documents to perform the analysis. Instead, it relies on a statistical model of word counts. The current implementation assumes a Poisson distribution of word frequencies. Positions are estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Confidence intervals for estimated positions can be generated from a parametric bootstrap.The name Wordfish pays tribute to the French meaning of the word “poisson”."

              "array([['1,2,1,1,20130429,ailac,\"Thank you Co-Chairs, I have the honor of speaking on behalf of AILAC the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean). Let me begin by associating our Group with the intervention made by Fiji on behalf of the Group.  We are beginning a new era of the negotiations, in which we can now place our full attention on the urgent work of the ADP. It is important to highlight, however, that we are now well into the second year of our work, out of a period of four years that we have given ourselves to negotiate and finalize a new agreement. At this point in time, we are approximately six months from the halfway point to the finish line, and we are only just beginning concrete discussions. For this reason we are conscious of the urgency driving us to take a meaningful step forward in these negotiations. Under these negotiations, we find ourselves with unique opportunity to agree on a truly transformative agreement that will meet the objective of the Convention and the 2?degree goal in order to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system. At this juncture, we see the need to be flexible and creative, and to consider in our discussions all relevant issues as well as the interlinkages between these issues. We should look at the relationships between the different topics of negotiation and avoid a compartmentalized approach. We believe that the Convention is a living instrument, which should be interpreted in a dynamic way. Its principles are tools that should allow for the effective implementation of the Convention, in light of today s realities. More specifically, we believe that the appropriate scope of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities is as follows: common responsibilities reflected in the adoption of legally binding commitments by all parties; differentiated responsibilities in the sense that each Party should a make a fair contribution; and respective capabilities that should be taken into account in order to define the nature and amount of Parties contribution in relation to mitigation as well as means of implementation. We should remember that this principle should be a tool for action and not a refuge or excuse for inaction. The operationalization of these principles should help us achieve sufficient levels of effort to achieve our common objective of protecting the climate system and keeping the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. These joint actions are the only ones that can really lead us to reduce climate change impacts. When we all act, we are reducing the impacts and protecting the most vulnerable, and only then will we have achieved true climate justice. To ensure that all of the principles and their implementation are carried out in an ethical and transparent way, we should think responsibly and urgently about the rules that will allow us to achieve transparency and comparability in the efforts that we must all take forward. The Convention recognizes our right to sustainable development. The challenge before us is to achieve this without it leading to a dangerous increase in emissions levels. Examples in our own region demonstrate the efforts that we are all making to implement low emissions development strategies that will allow us to decouple our trajectories of economic growth from an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts such as these should be recognized and supported and the new agreement should include positive incentives for all parties develop in a sustainable, low carbon way. Just as we are acting on mitigation, we are also carrying the burden of adaptation with our own national resources. So far, we have not seen these efforts aided by concrete support mechanisms. Our countries are losing capital due to climate change, which is preventing us from continuing on a path of sustainable development. 2013 is also the year in which we will begin to undertake the review. In this process, we should find the elements based in science that inform the negotiations for decision making in 2015. This process should be the corner stone to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention, in accordance with the precautionary principle. Let me also add that we support your idea to create a contact group. We are flexible on whether to do so here in the April session or during the second part of this session in June. Distinguished Co?Chairs, we have 24 hours of discussion over the next 5 days of this session, which we hope will be very productive. We have had twenty years of negotiations, and we have two left to reach a new agreement. At this moment, each hour counts, because hour by hour the impacts of climate change increase around the world. And as our Philippine colleagues reminded us in Doha, tomorrow it could be anyone of our countries facing the devastating and debilitating effects of a climate change related natural disaster or extreme weather event. Thank you, Co?Chairs.\"'],\n",
              "       ['2,2,1,1,20130429,aosis,\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of 44 countries that are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS associates itself. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me also thank you for your leadership during this phase of the negotiations. You have set the stage for us to make essential progress this week and beyond. I assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work expeditiously to close the emissions gap and fulfill other commitments laid out in the Durban agreement. The time we have to act, it cannot be said enough, is rapidly slipping away for the members of the group of countries that I represent. Scientists have warned that unless urgent and dramatic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, I repeat, well before 2020, the opportunity to avoid catastrophic global warming in excess of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - to say nothing of the below 1.5 degree threshold supported by over 100 countries in this room - could be irrevocably lost. The perilous circumstances we face were underscored last week when researchers at the Mauna Loa laboratory confirmed that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are on track to, this month, exceed 400 parts per million for sustained lengths of time throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere. This ominous milestone is particularly unsettling for the citizens of small island and low-lying coastal states who have already experienced life-altering changes due to warming of less than one-degree Celsius, including stronger and more deadly tropical cyclones, prolonged droughts, the loss of mangrove habitat, and, perhaps most alarmingly, an acceleration in sea level rise. What\\'s more, we know that coral reefs, which support many of our economies, and buffer us climate-related extreme weather events, are likely to stop growing if the 450-ppm mark is passed and start dissolving at concentrations beyond 550 ppm as ocean acidification intensifies. In light of these harsh realities, we must achieve an ADP agreement that ultimately brings CO2 concentrations back below these levels to limit warming below 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. Co-Chairs, It is in this context that AOSIS wants to emphasize- as we have done in our formal ADP submissions- that our work this week and in June must focus intensely on delivering concrete outcomes for the climate that sustains us all. We have no other formal process to address our concerns except this multilateral process and therefore failure for us is a direct threat to our very existence. With a view to giving this focus to our work, we have all agreed to organize our discussions into two separate workstreams - Workstrearm 2 is tasked with identifying ways to raise mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 timeframe and Workstrearm 1 with elaborating the details of a protocol to be adopted by 2015 at the latest. Work in both Workstrearms must be driven by a sense of urgency, bearing in mind that our failure to act decisively now will require a reactive and vastly more expensive response later. Moreover, a failure to close the pre-2020 initigation ambition gap will have profound implications for the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 protocol. But despite these linkages, the discussions for both workstreams must remain separate. In this context, we reiterate our call for two distinct contact groups to ensure that the subject matter for the two workstreatns is kept separate. In terms of Workstream 2, we need to use our two sessions in Bonn to focus closely on specific and scalable mitigation actions and policies that can be deployed immediately, including those outlined in the UNEP gap report, and also look at strategies for overcoming implementation barriers, including the scaled up delivery of financial resources, technology and capacity building. We welcome the roundtables proposed by the Co-Chairs, but will want to bring more focus to our work as the year proceeds. At the same time, we must expand the conversation beyond purely climate negotiators and work to engage those with on-the-ground expertise in the development and implementation of successful mitigation actions in this process-civil society, scientists, the private sector and experts from the relevant ministries within our governments. Of course, the decision to raise ambition ultimately requires engagement at the highest level, so we are calling for a ministerial meeting on raising mitigation ambition at COP19 in Warsaw to help build the political momentum necessary for the adoption of more ambitious mitigation targets by developed countries and NAMAs by developing countries. We welcomed the announcement made by the UN Secretary-General in Doha that he will convene a leaders summit in 2014, which will serve as an important decision point for countries to raise their ambition. Co-Chairs, We must also make progress in Workstream 1 on the core elements of the new legally binding agreement to be adopted in 2015. We know all too well that turning policy into action can be a painfully slow process, so the decisions we make today must be guided by the science, and sufficiently ambitious to protect the interests of future generations, as well as our own. Our work moving forward should continue to build on the foundations of the Convention, including its fundamental principles and provisions. In the view of AOSIS, the outcome of the process launched under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action should be a Protocol under the Convention applicable to all Parties, to be adopted no later than 2015, which strengthens the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, based on science and designed to ensure the survival of the communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Being applicable to all, it wil require universal participation and contributions from every Party. As we see the alarming impacts of our past of inaction on climate change unfold before our eyes, and the very real economic, social and physical costs of this inaction grow larger, perversely, the solutions to the climate crisis are more accessible and less costly than ever before. Nevertheless there is an ongoing need for financial support and technology transfer and capacity building to developing countries. This is about political will, and our mandate from Durban makes it clear that this process shall raise ambition. We urge all Parties to work with an increased sense of urgency this week and above all focus on doing our part to achieve all ambitious, comprehensive and meaningful outcome. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['3,2,1,1,20130429,arab,\"Distinguished Co-Chairs I have the honor to take the floor on behalf of the Arab Group comprising the 22 member states of the League of Arab States. Let me first start by associating the Arab Group. The Arab group congratulates you on the effective and cordial manner in which you have led our work since last April. We look forward to a productive and constructive dialogue and exchange of views under your leadership this week and in the resumed June session. The Arab Group considers that the international climate change regime is founded on the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and of the KP. Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention represent in our view the basis for international cooperation in the fight against climate change, namely through the principle of CBDR , equity, and the responsibility for historical emissions, and the absolute priority for developing countries to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication in line with their national strategies and priorities. These fundamentals are not to be reinterpreted or renegotiated but instead our work should be grounded on them and they should be reemphasized in any 2015 outcome we collectively reach. The Arab Group stresses that our objective should be the full and sustained implementation of the Convention through the full implementation of the outcomes emanating from the Bali processes and the Durban and Doha decisions. Our working the ADP shall be informed of the progress in implementation of the commitments made in Durban and Doha relative to the second commitment period of the KP and the implementation and delivery of commitments in the areas of adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. Merely creating new institutions is not enough , but should be translated into concrete time-bound deliverables to assist developing countries requirements for adaptation and mitigation. In this regard, we call for our deliberations in the ADP to be constantly informed by the progress reached in the various subsidiary bodies. In fact, in our view, any 2015 outcome should not be mitigation-centered but should incorporate and integrate all these aspects for which much efforts have been exerted since 2005. We call for balanced progress in our work in the elaboration of the content of all these building blocks. Our goal should be to bridge the ambition gaps in all these matters with the same level of seriousness and resolve if we are to deliver by 2015 an outcome that is effective and that all could feel ownership of. The Arab Group will no doubt assume its fair share of the global efforts to combat climate change. Much is already taking place in individual Arab countries to delink their economic development strategies from the growth of their emissions and to implement new and renewable energy strategies. However, Arab countries will not agree with any attempt to move away or side step the founding principles of international cooperation in the field of climate change, or any attempt by some to renege on their legal obligation to take the lead in global efforts by shifting to developing countries the burden to fill the gap between the level of required emission reductions required by science and their low mitigation commitments. We believe that in order to foster trust and give a push to the ADP negotiations, Annex 1 countries members of the KP are called upon to urgently complete their ratification of the second commitment period, and revise their mitigation ambition upward in 2014. Non- KP Annex 1 countries or Annex 1 countries that chose not to be part of the second commitment period of the KP are called upon to exert comparable emission reduction efforts. There should also be a swift progress in the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund as well as urgently addressing the missing elements pertaining to long term finance in the Doha outcome. Furthermore, we call on all sides to desist from unilateral trade measures in the name of climate change, and to effectively address the socio-economic impact of response measures on developing countries and assist those countries in need to diversify their economies in order to face the repercussions of climate change. In closing, the Arab Group reiterates its commitment to work with all parties towards the success of our collective journey to 2015 so that its outcome responds to the aspirations of the international community, and to realize a shift in the mindset in these international negotiations away from finger pointing to a principled approach grounded on equity and fairness. I thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['4,2,1,1,20130429,eig,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. By 2015 we must adopt a legally binding instrument from 2020 that will be an effective response to the urgent challenge of climate change; 2015 is around the corner - we need a clear vision of milestones over the next three years: this year we must achieve and capture core elements of the 2015 Agreement, including in relation to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, capacity building and common rules; The EIG is ready to work with you and all the Parties in a focused manner to this aim; The EIG calls for a legally binding instrument with all Parties taking appropriate mitigation commitments of same legal form, which includes targets or actions, under the same rules and at different depths in terms of type of commitment, timing, and level of effort according to CBDR/RC and equity; The instrument must also adequately address Adaptation, Support and transparency. Dynamic differentiation between the Parties according to CBRD/RC and equity is key for a fair and enduring instrument. A common understanding on a fair differentiation must be developed in order to address the climate challenge and respond to findings of latest scientific knowledge; Mr. Co-Chairs, Mitigation is not a break to development but an opportunity for wellbeing and development; The 2015 Agreement must be a win-win instrument for all: else we will not succeed; We have another very urgent matter at hand: pre-2020 ambition; We have to close the emissions gap in view of achieving the target to keep global warming below 2 degrees with respect to historic levels. Therefore, there is a need to increased action within and outside the Convention. The EIG countries are ready to cooperate with the other Parties to discuss these approaches in view to make progress on workstream 2. Mr. Co-chairs, The EIG would also like to underline the importance of the other ongoing processes relevant for success under workstreams 1 and 2 of the ADP. This includes: the clarification of the 2020-pledges, supporting the needs for implementation and progress in the understanding and predictability of mobilisation of climate finance. Especially, the EIG countries emphasize the urgency of the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund.\"'],\n",
              "       ['5,2,1,1,20130429,eu,\"I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, its 27 Member States and Croatia. In Durban, we reaffirmed our shared goal of keeping the global temperature increase below 2?C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. We know that we face potentially devastating impacts if we fail to achieve this goal. We also know that, collectively, Parties are not yet on an emissions pathway consistent with that goal. Global GHG emissions continue to increase. As the Executive Secretary has indicated, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are exceeding levels ever experienced in human history and are predicted to exceed 400ppm by 2014. We have also had recent reports on the potential consequences of failure to stay within the temperature goal. There is an urgent need for progress. In Doha, the EU and others signed up to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which we are already implementing. All Parties contributed to bringing the LCA to a successful conclusion. Demonstrating progress on the implementation of Cancun pledges by those outside the KP second commitment period may be more difficult, but is just as important to the climate. In this context, it was very welcome and useful that the SB Chairs provided an update on their work; we see the value in further such updates as our work progresses. This week needs to set a positive basis for the year ahead as we move towards Warsaw. The EU is ready to work with all Parties to move quickly into focused discussions on the issues at hand. Under the ADP, we agreed to work towards a single, fair and comprehensive, legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties. We acknowledged the urgent need to close the pre-2020 mitigation gap to keep the below 2?C goal within reach. Mr. co-Chairs, we fully support the goal of this session, set out in your informal note, to build on the broad, conceptual and scoping discussions we had in 2012, and engage in more specific and detailed work on the core elements of the 2015 agreement and a practical and results-orientated approach to increasing pre-2020 ambition. Under workstream one, we welcome the workshop on the scope, structure and design of the 2015 agreement and subsequent roundtables. In particular, we look forward to identifying with other Parties how they see a spectrum of mitigation commitments emerging in such a way that is fair and reflects evolving economic realities and development opportunities for all Parties while ensuring an adequate global response to the climate change challenge, taking into account the need to keep the global temperature increase below 2?C goal. Under workstream 2, we need to work on identifying concrete actions that will help us close the gap between what science tells us is required and the pledges put forward by Parties to date. We know that there are a number of ways to achieve this, including through more and enhanced pledges as well as through international cooperative initiatives. In response to the urgency expressed by all Parties at Durban and reaffirmed at Doha, workstream 2 must, this year, produce tangible deliverables that result in actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Raising ambition through existing and new pledges is essential but we must also take concrete steps on additional actions that offer significant potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale.

              "       ['6,2,1,1,20130429,g77china,\"Mr. Co-Chairs I have the honor to deliver this statement. This being the first meeting of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, it is my welcome duty to express here the appreciation of the Group on the sterling leadership with which you Co- Chairs conducted our affairs last year. The Group appreciated the skillful manner in which you steered our discussions. We have become accustomed to your Leaderships. The Group looks forward once again to working with you this year; I assure you that you can again count. Mr. Co- Chairs In Doha we decided that the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action ADP) will consider elements for a draft negotiating text no later than at its session to be held in conjunction with the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties, due to be held from Wednesday, 3 December to Sunday, 14 December 2014, with a view to making available a negotiating text before May 2015. Also in Doha, we decided to identify and to explore in 2013 options for a range of actions that can close the pre-2020 ambition gap with a view to identifying further activities for its plan of work in 2014 ensuring the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention. The Group acknowledges with appreciation the work and the thinking that are reflected in the Informal Note which you have kindly circulated prior to this meeting. We have taken due note of your suggested goals for the session, we appreciate the sharing of your ideas and proposals on how the work of the ADP2 is to be organised and we are currently reflecting on the sets of questions which you ve posed for our discussion. May I convey that the Group concurs that this April Session should be utilised to build on the broad, conceptual and scoping discussions carried out last year and to that end will support efforts by parties to engage in more specific and detailed work on the core elements of the 2015 agreement and a practical and result- orientated approach to increasing pre- 2020 ambition. Mr Co- Chairs The Group takes note of the proposal by the two Co-Chairs to establish the contact group at this session of the ADP. The Group supports in principle the establishment of the contact group under the two Co-Chairs to facilitate work and focus. The contact group would convene when necessary with the agreement of the parties. Mr Co-Chairs Let me now make some substantive remarks on the ADP. The following are very clear in our mind: The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles. and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of  implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. In addition, the Group of 77 and China applauds the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Our efforts should now be focused on bringing those amendments into effect at the earliest opportunity. We therefore urge all Parties to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible. The Group is also of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. Indeed, it should strengthen the multilateral rule-based regime in order for the Convention to achieve its ultimate objective. Finally, we consider that any action to increase pre- 2020 ambition should be guided by the objectives and principles of the Convention. Given the urgency of our situation, the Group wishes to highlight the need to increase and expedite efforts to close the ambition gap. In addressing this gap, focus must not only be limited to mitigation but also address gaps relating to finance, technology and support for capacity building. Failure to address these gaps will not only have impact in the short term but will also have profound impact on the scale of commitment that would be required under the 2015 agreement, which should be guided by the principles and provisions of the Convention. In this connection, the Group reiterates its call for developed countries to take leadership and do more in the provision of the means of implementation. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['7,2,1,1,20130429,ldc,\"Co-Chairs, Madam Executive Secretary and colleagues. Nepal has the honor to make this statement on behalf of the LDCs. I associate myself with the statement. Co-Chairs, first of all, we express our appreciation to the Government of Germany for hosting this meeting. We would also like to express our gratitude to all the Parties that have provided voluntary contributions to make this meeting possible and to the Secretariat for the excellent arrangements. Co-Chairs, for the proposed workshops and roundtable discussions, we urge you to give us sufficient time for discussions. In terms of contact groups, our preference is to have two contact groups for the two workstreams. We hope this will be the case in the future. We are also delighted that you have allocated a special session for observers. Co-Chairs, under workstream I, it is time to start defining the structure and content of a robust science-based, equitable and inclusive regime to tackle climate change in an effective and efficient manner. The thematic areas need to be addressed in a way to keep the ADP manageable and provide it with the opportunity to deliver in a timely manner. The common but differentiated responsibilities; countries\\x19 different and evolving capabilities; equity; historical, current and future trend of emissions; all need to be addressed in a meaningful and constructive manner, and not hold back the discussions. Co-Chairs, Parties should initiate discussions around the many complex and crucial issues needed to operationalize the principles and provisions of the Convention and define what kind of approaches and types of commitments could be considered while designing the 2015 regime. How do we effectively articulate the various elements of the future regime: mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity building, technology, transparency of action and support in a balanced manner? Co-Chairs, we value the opportunity provided by workstream II to rapidly identify and implement enhanced mitigation actions with a view to stopping, reversing and closing the gap by 2020, to avoid increased impacts and to minimize climate induced loss and damage. Issues regarding the means to support rapid implementation of urgent but win-win mitigation options are a central component of workstream II. Co-Chairs, adaptation is an extremely important issue especially for the LDCs as well as for other vulnerable countries. We believe action on adaptation should be further enhanced in the ADP. Nevertheless, adaptation will have its limits; therefore, in the long-term mitigation is the best form of adaptation. Otherwise, LDCs will be confronted with a situation where adaptation requirements will far exceed capacities even if all possible international support would be provided. Co-Chairs, you will recall that in Durban, the LDC group supported the agreement on workstream II with the specific mandate to close the emissions gap between the current level of ambition and what science tells us we need to achieve to be able to limit global warming below 1.5??C. We would like to see substantial progress on pre-2020 mitigation ambition, as the success or the failure of workstream II would affect the results negotiated under workstream I on the post-2020 agreement. As the world??s most vulnerable, we have the moral right to claim that all the countries must take immediate and urgent climate action. We know that political will can close most of the gaps that would lead us to an unthinkable future. Though the science-driven climate project achieved a great deal, we now know that science alone cannot take us further. We need more action on the ground, driven by scientifically informed political will. The LDCs will continue to engage productively and proactively and will continue to play a leadership role in the interest of the nearly one billion most vulnerable people that we represent in this process.

Co-Chairs, We come to this meeting ready to get to work - under your able leadership. We are all familiar with what the ADP has been asked to deliver. Through a new global agreement, and work on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition, we have been tasked with delivering a more effective response to climate change. A response built on common action and ambitious global co-operation, and which revitalises the UNFCCC for the challenges of a new century. We want a global regime that helps foster national action - because it is national action that will ultimately reduce emissions, prepare countries for climate impacts, and build climate considerations into long-term economic and development planning. Throughout last year and at Doha we had useful, conceptual discussions and made some progress in identifying areas of commonality and convergence under both workstreams. But if we are to deliver our work on time in 2015, we need to keep bringing greater focus and depth to our discussions. Co-Chairs, The world is looking to us all to deliver a climate effective new agreement, applicable to all Parties, by 2015. To do so we now need to engage on the hard questions that lie at the heart of the agreement. And we need to better understand each other - the factors that will pull countries toward ambitious participation in the new agreement, as well as the factors that may hinder participation. We look forward to further discussions, at this session, on how we can design the new agreement in a way that: captures the participation of all Parties, with a spectrum of contributions that sees all countries act in a way that reflects their national circumstances; allows flexibility for countries differing contexts and capacities, but also ensures the transparency and environmental integrity of action\"'],\n",
              "       ['9,2,2,2,20130604,ag,\"Co-Chairs. We wish to express our appreciation. We also thank those countries that have made contributions, which have enabled us to participate at these SBs sessions. I take this opportunity to thank you for how you have guided the work of the ADP so far, and further thank you Co-Chairs for convening part 2 of the 2nd session of the ADP. The Africa Group pledges its support to you as we enter a more focused mode of work, building on the plan of work we agreed on in Doha and advancing the discussions from the first part of the second session we had in April/May. Co-Chairs, the Africa Group generally supports the proposals made in your information note of the 24th of May 2013, particularly in regards to the organization of work where this June session is being resumed, having been adjourned in May. We view this June session as important in further deepening our focused work though workshops and roundtables. Further, in the interests of advancing the discussion and making progress, we view the June session as building blocks towards taking some decisions at COP19 In November. From the outset, Co-Chairs, let me reiterate that in respect of the 2015 agreement, it is the Group s view that all the principles and provisions of the Convention apply. As such, the ADP is not a renegotiation of the Convention and its Annexes. Further, the Africa Group views the work of the ADP as a realization of a balanced package from Durban in respect of and agreement to negotiate an agreement that will guide the implementation of the Convention beyond 2020. Co-Chairs, given Africa s situation, sustainable development and poverty eradication remain the priorities for the continent; therefore the agreement should reinforce a fair, multilateral rules based regime that brings to effect the right to equitable access to sustainable development. In this respect, we would like to emphasise that adaptation is a key issue for the African continent. As such, the Group welcomes the workshop on enhancing adaptation through the 2015 agreement and calls for discussions to consider a global adaptation goal that is linked to a global temperature goal. Co-Chairs, in respect to Workstream II, we welcome the discussion on enhanced actions but urge that these be expanded to incorporate issues of compliance with scientifically-determined targets and the MRV of the means of implementation. In this respect, Co-Chairs, the Africa Group calls for leadership from developed countries in raising ambitions as a basis of building trust. In relation to linkages with other bodies of the Convention, We note the briefing sessions from other Convention related bodies and further call for discussion on how the established bodies of the Convention will relate to the work of the ADP. Co-Chairs, it is the Africa Group s position that to facilitate fairness in the contributions by various Parties towards the achievement of the global goals, as well as towards operationalisation of equity rather than its definition, a non-binding, principle-based Equity Reference Framework that reflects relative fair efforts by Parties in responding to mitigation and adaption is necessary. The relative efforts should consider the combined mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology responsibility of a Party, against which nationally derived commitments can be assessed. Co-Chairs, we recognize the timelines between now and the expected draft text next year and call for a September session. The September session should deepen the discussion on the ADP and produce a report that the new Co-Chairs can use for continuity. The Africa Group calls for progress towards establishing a contact group, and in particular to clarify how many contact groups should be established. The September meeting could give us the opportunity to discuss this and avoid further delays on contact groups.  Co-Chairs, Africa stands ready to work constructively during these two weeks and the next ones in November and to engage meaningfully in identifying means and ways respecting both national circumstances, voluntary essence of mitigations actions for developing countries, in the context of relevant principles and provisions of the Convention. Co-Chairs, I thank You. \"'],\n",
              "       ['10,2,2,2,20130604,ailac,\"Thank you Mr. Chair, good morning colleagues. Being this the first time we take the floor, we\\'d like to thank you and congratulate your efforts so far, we remain in your hands and will continue to support your endeavors; AILACs spirit in these negotiations is to build bridges within the variety of realities, capacities and responsibilities among different groups and countries. We have the willingness to act and remain at your disposal for ideas, available to enhance our ambition and to lead with example; In this spirit, we believe the purpose of the ADP should be focused in enhancing action for achieving the 1.5C global goal, that is to say to fulfill the ultimate objective of the Convention; We agree that our work is not in a vacuum, but is oriented by all the work carried on under the Convention, and directed to its ultimate goal; We all have something to contribute to this end. AILAC is and will continue its efforts to contribute. However, the aggregate efforts have proven insufficient, with the impacts of inactions affecting all parties broadly; in this context, the work under both ADP workstreams call for urgency; The design of the agreement should appropriately combine elements of a bottom-up approach, that should allow for each party to define it s own contribution, taking into account its national circumstances and capacity, with elements from a top-down structure to enable comparability of efforts and ensure that the efforts undertaken are leading us to achieve the 1.5C global goal. Whatever the design of the commitment structure, it must have at least the following characteristics. It should be: Differentiated, according to our national circumstances; Time-bound; Quantified in terms of reduced or avoided GHG emissions; Subject to comparability based on transparency; and finally; Open to external scrutiny Co-chairs, we are concerned. The discussion seems to have a tendency to evolve towards an over-flexibilization of the regime. At this early stage we should strategically be aiming at the highest possible ambition. In this context, we understand flexibility is necessary in  multilateralism. This should not prevent some basic elements to be incorporated in the 2015 agreement: The existence a common rules-based system; The scientific foundation of our work that has to be at the core of our agreements to secure the environmental integrity of the results; The transparency of the regime in terms the efforts undertaken and the results achieved; Co-Chairs, the discussions on differentiation is fundamental and helpful in order achieve universal participation in the new agreement, as well as effective and transparent comparability of effort that requires accurate data analyses; AILAC believes there must be a robust review process in the new agreement, simultaneous for all parties, while differentiated according to the nature of the party s commitment. It should allow for ex ante and ex post review, It is our view that means of Implementation should be enshrined in the 2015 agreement. In practice, this implies that matters related to finance, technology transfer and capacity building are included in the agreement. In particular, we see that the agreement would include quantified commitments on the provision of finance for climate change action. We also consider that it is fundamental that these commitments are part of the ex-ante and ex-post review processes that are emerging as a means to ratchet up mitigation ambition in the 2015 agreement. Adaptation must also be part of the core of the 2015 agreement, in a balanced manner. We need to build upon the current institutions under the Convention, but also go beyond the status-quo by giving adaptation an equally important space in the agreement as mitigation. The new agreement should also include commitments in terms off funding for adaptation. Loss and damage will need to be fully addressed in the new 2015 agreement. Finally, our success in achieving the Conventions ultimate objective will require a robust compliance mechanism for the commitments undertaken by all parties. Dear co-chairs, we believe work under WS2, according to the paragraphs 7 and 8 of decision 1cp17, should focus in closing the mitigation gap pre-2020, in order to achieve our common global goal of limiting temperature rise below 2 to 1.5C, as required by science. We would like to recall, the fact that the main reason why we succeeded in getting an agreement on the ADP in Durban was the inclusion of this workstream, following the lead of our colleagues from AOSIS. In this sense, we welcome the pragmatic approach taken so far in the development of our work program, focusing first and foremost in the sectors that offer the higher and most cost effective, scalable mitigation potential. The energy sector is a good starting point, despite the fact that we are available to consider undertaking similar approaches to other key sectors, namely: a broader approach to energy including generation, transmission, distribution and consumption), transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors. The non-paper presented by our distinguished colleagues from AOSIS is a valuable input to this end, which we very much welcome. We strongly believe that work under this workstream depends on a mutual reinforcement between momentum achieved at the national level, where we as negotiators and sectorial experts play a paramount role, and the political leverage that stems from our efforts in this forum. If only the lowest ambition pledges are implemented, emissions could be lowered to 53Gt C02eq by 2020, leaving us with a Gap of 9Gt Co2eq needed to have a likely chance of limiting global warming to 22c. Now, even in a scenario where the highest ambition of all country commitments under the Cancun Agreements are implemented and supported, the gap will remain at around 7 Gton Co2eq. This emphasizes the urgency of delivering concrete results under WS2, and the need for us all to enhance actions to mitigate before 2020. AILAC is extremely concerned at a time when we have surpassed the threshold of 400 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. Therefore, we believe we must identify concrete actions that will allow al l Parties to enhance contributions towards bridging the gap.\"'],\n",

Mr President, we would like to reiterate ALBA commitment to support their work and assist in identifying commonalities so that we can move forward with the implementation of the Convention. Additionally, we would like to express on this occasion our perspectives on the work that ADP has done and should continue to do doing to fulfill its mandate.  Dear colleagues, We must be honest and express ALBA concern for the progress and focus that the work of the ADP is developing. Us I would like to remind everyone of what was agreed in decision 1 of 17 Conference of the Parties, which clearly establishes the mandate of the Why are we here together? We agreed on the one hand to start the work of this action group reinforced to develop a protocol, other legal instrument or a Conclusion agreed with legal force in the framework of the Convention that be applicable to all Parties, period. This process should not be wrong interpreted and we are concerned that some countries have interpreted the itself, as a mandate to change the Convention, its principles and including its annexes and that the discussion be conducted in this way without real solutions. The aforementioned decision also details that the work of this group should include work related to adaptation, financing, technology development and transfer, the transparency of measures and provision of support and capacity-building. For this reason, we express that the result of the ADP should not focus on legally binding mitigation commitments, regardless the means of implementation of the Convention. Another point that is important to specify are the commitments that each country has in the Convention, for which I allow myself to remember your article 4 in which it clearly indicates the differentiation between what all Parties should do and what developed country Parties are committed to do. Additionally, we must express our concern when some of the positions presented in the sessions of this group suggest that we ignore another vital article importance in the Convention the same one that I allow myself to remember in detail and especially so that developed countries can remember it clearly: The extent to which developing country Parties lead to the effectively practice its commitments under the Convention will depend on the way in which developed country Parties effectively implement their commitments regarding financial resources and technology transfer, and you will have fully bear in mind that economic and social development and eradication of poverty are the first and essential priorities of developing country Parties. Mr President, there is a historical debt and we must not deceive ourselves think that the same development opportunities have come for all and that we must disappear the emissions history as suggested in the previous meeting of this group held in this same city. Doing this would not be in accordance with the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities, ratified even by our heads of state at the Rio+20 Conference. ALBA is concerned that we continue to put at risk our Mother Earth, our Nature, a place where it reproduces and realizes life and you have the right to be protected in a way integral, as well as their existence and regeneration of their life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes. In this sense, the change climate threatens the rights of all human beings and the nature and its basic right of protection. We feel it is our duty to remind all Parties that the Kyoto Protocol was to help meet the ultimate goal of the Convention, and still must. In this way, the entry into force immediate second commitment period and review of the level of Your Parties ambition in 2014 is absolutely CRUCIAL. Mr. President, we want to invite all States Part of this Convention to respect its objectives, mandates and agreements in accordance with the provisions of pacta sunt servanda, so that we can ensure that future human lives have the same and better quality and opportunities that we have had. The people of our countries have this right and for those people sir ALBA President expresses his commitment to work and continue contributing in the discussion under this group. Thank you Mr. President.\"'],\n",
              "       ['12,2,2,2,20130604,aosis,\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of 44 countries that are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS aligns itself with the statement made by Fiji on behalf the Group of 77 and China, and the statements made by Nepal on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group and Swaziland on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you again for your leadership. You have set the stage for us to make substantial progress at this session and beyond, and I assure you of our continued support as we work to close the emissions gap and fulfill the ultimate objective of the Convention. Our work this session must be motivated by a renewed sense of urgency, bearing in mind that time is running out for the countries I represent. Scientists have confirmed that unless we dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term, well before 2020, the opportunity to keep global warming below the 1.5-degree threshold that is essential to ensure the survival of all our members may be irrevocably lost. Thus in ADP Workstream 2, we must promote opportunities to mitigate by focusing on specific mitigation policies and actions that have the greatest promise, are cost effective and scalable. Then, we must enable interested Parties to deploy these immediately, by engaging those with on-the-ground expertise in the development and implementation of successful mitigation actions, and by overcoming barriers to implementation, such as the delivery of scaled-up financial resources, technology, and capacity building. We were grateful for the broad support our Workstream 2 non-paper enjoyed at the last session and look forward to elaborating on it further this session. As I said, concrete progress on Workstream 2 is required to prevent a catastrophe for us all, particularly the most vulnerable. It is also important to remember that a failure to close the mitigation ambition gap by acting decisively now will have profound implications for the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 agreement. We know that effectively dealing with climate change will demand a sustained effort for decades to come so discussions under Workstream 1 of the ADP must also be ambitious enough to protect the interests of future generations as well as our own. It is the view of AOSIS that the outcome of the process launched in Durban should be a Protocol under the Convention applicable to all Parties, to be adopted no later than 2015. As we continue to develop the core elements of the new legally binding agreement, we should build on the foundations of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, including their fundamental principles and provisions. The new legally binding agreement should be based on the best available science, strengthen the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, and ensure the survival of the most vulnerable. Co-Chairs, In addition to other key elements raised in the co-chairs note, elements that AOSIS sees as absolutely essential to the ADP agreement include: mitigation ambition at a scale that can keep warming well below 1.5 degrees Celsius; a mechanism to address Loss and Damage; and a compliance system to give confidence that the commitments of all Parties will be met. We urge world leaders to work expeditiously to generate the political will required for us to be successful. We welcomed the announcement made by UN Secretary-General Ban that he will convene a leaders summit in 2014 and see it as an important decision point for Parties, with developed countries taking the lead by putting forward more ambitious targets using the 2014 Kyoto Protocol ratchet mechanism and for non-KP Parties to make comparable commitments. We must all work together to raise ambition to the scale and on the timeframe needed to tum us away from disaster. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['13,2,2,2,20130604,basic,\"Thank you Co-Chairs. I have the privilege of delivering this statement.  We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China We acknowledge the sterling efforts of the Co-Chairs in advancing the work of this subsidiary body since last year. We hope that this session, which will mark the end of tenure for the two Co-Chairs, will result in tangible progress and guide the future work under the ADP process. Mr. Co-Chairs, As we resume our work in this second part of the second session of the ADP, we fully trust that the Co-Chairs will permeate balance in all aspects of work under the ADP keeping in view that the April and June session are to seen as parts of a whole. Mr. Co-Chairs, We reaffirm that the objective of the Durban Platform negotiations is to further strengthen the multilateral rule-based climate regime, ensuring the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. The Durban Platform is by no means a process to negotiate a new regime, nor to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or reinterpret but should rather reaffirm the Convention and apply its principles and provisions. Both the process and the outcome of the Durban Platform are under the Convention and must fully adhere to all its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Mr. Co-Chairs, We stress that the work of Durban Platform cannot be carried out in a vaccum. It must be based on and build on the work carried out by Parties under the Bali Road Map. As agreed in its mandate under para 6 of decision 1/CP.17, the work of ADP must be informed by IPCC, The 2013-15 Review and the subsidiary bodies. The work under ADP must therefore evolve on the basis of information received from these bodies. To this end, the ADP must institutionalise a mechanism for receiving and accounting for regular and comprehensive feedback from the respective subsidiary bodies/mechanisms. It is also important that technical work in the subsidiary bodies be formalised in decisions, to record progress between now and 2015. Mr. Co-Chairs, The work of Durban Platform is a comprehensive process, covering mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building and transparency must address the issues related to these pillars of the Convention in a holistic, balanced and coordinated manner. The enhanced actions under the Durban Platform should translate into enhanced actions under each of the pillars identified in para 5 of decision 1/CP.17 i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building and transparency. In our work in June session and beyond we need to bring more focus to structuring our discussions on each of these pillars in a much more organized manner. These focused discussions are necessary to find convergence on enhanced actions that are central to the ADP outcome. Mr. Co-Chairs, We stressed that the pre-2020 ambition should primarily be addressed in the context of actions of parties under KP CP2 and the agreed outcome pursuant to Bali Action Plan and in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. The low levels of Annex I ambition under both Kyoto Protocol and the Convention remains a matter of grave concern. There is evidently a huge ambition gap between what developed country Parties have pledged and what is required by science and their historical responsibility. Therefore, we underline that the developed countries who have taken commitments under the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol must raise their ambition level in 2014 in consonance with science and their historical responsibility. At the same time, they strongly emphasized that developed countries which are not part of Kyoto Protocol or have not joined the 2nd commitment period must equally raise their ambition in the same timeframe and take on comparable mitigation commitments under the Convention. The gap can rather be overachieved if developed countries demonstrate the lead and scale up ambition not just in mitigation but also in provision of enabling financial resources, environmentally sound technologies and capacity building to support mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries. This will necessitate early and meaningful operationalization of the mechanisms set up in recent years to support developing countries in particular the GCF. Mr. Co-Chairs, We cannot fully stress the importance of capitalisation of the GCF as a means of restoring trust and building momentum for the ADP. In this regard, the operationalization of Technology Mechanism and Adaptation Committee are also important. Mr. Co-Chairs, BASIC re-iterates its full support to the Co-Chairs in advancing the work of ADP in an open, transparent, party-driven and inclusive manner. I thank you, Mr Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",

We believe that under your leadership, and that of our other Chairs in this process, we will have a clearer road map to reach our common goal of a climate-safe world. Mr. Chair, Countries of the Cartagena Dialogue for Progressive Action met from 8 to 10 April 2013 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A representative of the UNFCCC Secretariat was also present at the meeting. Mr. Chair, The clock is ticking and the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has already reached 400 ppm. The Cartagena Dialogue assumes added importance in this situation as the members of the Cartagena Dialogue are committed domestically with their respective capabilities to pursue low carbon economic and development pathways, and also committed to pursuing global action through a legally binding international agreement applicable to all. The Dhaka meeting provided an informal space for these countries to work together, within and across regional groupings and traditional negotiating blocks towards - an ambitious and effective legally binding new agreement; building political momentum for increased pre-2020 ambition; and - sustaining momentum in the implementation of a climate action through the UNFCCC, including through the important work of the Subsidiary Bodies. The meeting highlighted the importance of operationalising the newly created frameworks, mechanisms, institutions and processes in an expeditious manner with a view to strengthening the existing and future climate change management. It was underscored that the implementation issues are crucially important to build mutual trust and confidence. Delegates also felt it important for maintaining effectively linkages between discussions under the SBs and the ADP, so that existing processes, institutions and frameworks, etc. can add value to ADP process, particularly in relation to mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency. Building on this foundation, participants considered that the 2015 agreement should create an effective, robust, multilateral rules-based regime. They underlined the importance of ensuring effective climate action, as called for by climate science, and ensuring universal participation on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and differing national circumstances, supported by means of implementation where needed. Ideas were explored around a spectrum of commitments to allow for action by all Parties in line with their differing capabilities. Participants also discussed the importance of building the appropriate implementation conditions to allow greater pre-2020 ambition. Focusing on low-hanging mitigation potential was emphasized, as well as the importance of supplementary initiatives outside of the UNFCCC without prejudice to the Convention process. It was also recognized that Ministerial engagement on pre2020 ambition would be essential at COP 19 and at the upcoming summit called by the UN Secretary General. It is expected that the institutional mechanisms and Implementation frameworks in progress in the Subsidiary Bodies and the COP, would contribute to creating the right conditions for enhanced action without further delay. Mr. Chair, Meetings such as the Cartagena Dialogue that we have recently hosted are important to better understand Parties positions and work in the best spirit of cooperation to find common ground for action by all. We must all work together if we are to address the root cause and challenges of climate change and keep warming to below at least two degrees Celsius. We cannot afford to delay action any longer since our existence as humanity is at stake.\"'],\n",

When we met just over a month ago, we had open and productive conversations on the new global agreement, and on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. These allowed us to make real progress understanding each others interests and ideas for advancing a practical, ambitious global multilateral rules-based framework on climate change. As we said in May, we need solutions that can strengthen the UNFCCC legal framework for the challenges of a new century, and promote national action and development co-benefits. We look forward to continuing discussion in the same spirit at this session. Our ideas are maturing, and areas of potential convergence are becoming more clear. We look forward to further discussions, at this session, on the scope, structure and design of the new agreement, including issues such as: How we could define a spectrum of commitments, What elements could ensure the transparency, ambition and fairness of those commitments, What is the best way to promote and support implementation; How adaptation should be reflected in the new agreement, and Use of flexible mechanisms for meeting commitments. On the ambition workstream, we would like to see, as we did at the meeting in May, concrete and practical discussion identifying where there is potential to scale up action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that would help countries individually and collectively to do more. We also hope the ADP discussions can help create an environment which encourages the 100-odd countries that have not yet made a 2020 pledge, to do so, and an environment that incentivises those with pledges to raise their ambition. As we consider ways to raise mitigation ambition, we must continue to explore complementary initiatives alongside the UNFCCC, and use their potential for enhanced action on mitigation pre 2020. And we must continue engaging key nonParty actors, including representatives from sub-national bodies, civil society and the private sector, who are the key agents of action on the ground, to support Parties in their actions.\"'],\n",

We associate ourselves with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of G77 and China, Swaziland on behalf of the Africa Group and Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. Co-Chairs, the current gap in mitigation ambition places us on track for a 4 degree plus world. We all arrived in Bonn as the atmospheric C02 concentration surpassed the 400 ppm mark. Allowing the concentration to increase further is suicidal with catastrophic implications. In the midst of these challenges, however, we have another historic opportunity to strengthen the current climate regime by adopting a new Protocol applicable to all Parties in 2015. We urge all Parties not to lose sight of this goal. Achievement of the 2?C goal, agreed under the Convention, leading towards 1.5 degrees requires ambitious reductions of global greenhouse emissions by all Parties, and this should have already begun. We are behind schedule, and time is not our side. Co-Chairs, moving forward under both the ADP workstreams with a balanced and focused approach is fundamental to a mutually agreed outcome and this session must provide a positive momentum for Warsaw. Under Workstream 1: We are concerned by the discussions during the roundtables at the last session, moving toward locking some Parties in a vicious circle 0k low ambition under an unsustainable bottom-up approach. As we all know, the 2015 agreement would be meaningful only if it is based on a clear science-based approach; and is consistent with the objective of the Convention. The LDCs welcome the proposal to hold a workshop on adaptation. This is an extremely important element of the ADP. We expect to clarify the added value of the new treaty for adaptation, particularly for developing countries. We are eager to provide you with ideas for incorporating adaptation within the legal agreement. In addition, we propose holding a focused workshop on the role of means of implementation to trigger effective climate actions in developing countries. We also believe the International Mechanism on Loss and Damage should be incorporated within a new legal agreement. We will also provide you with ideas on how this could be achieved. Co-chairs, we urgently need to change our mode of operation to commence work on developing the new legal agreement. We encourage you to focus the discussions towards that end and start calling for proposals on legal form in subsequent discussions in Warsaw to meet a deadline of adopting a Protocol by 2015. Co-Chairs, we are happy that you have prioritized the Workstream 2 discussions on mitigation options that could have win-win benefits, especially those that have co-benefits for development and adaptation. We are happy with the proposed workshop on energy. The Technical paper by the Secretariat on compilation of information on mitigation benefits shows that there is high potential to close the ambition gap, but that window of opportunity is closing very fast. We need to be focused and outcome-oriented under this workstream. This outcome needs to be reflected by: a. enhanced pledges by Annex I KP Parties through the KP review process by 2014; b. moving the Annex I Party commitments under the Convention towards the upper end of the range, and c. enhanced NAMAs by developing countries We would like to remind all Parties that the assurance for additional pre-2020 mitigation ambition through Workstream 2 is a key element of the Durban package and that the work under Workstream 2 determines the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 Protocol. Co-Chairs, building trust as well as building upon the existing foundations is critical to deliver the results mandated in this process. To this extent, developed countries must show leadership by raising their ambition as well as mobilizing resources for developing countries. We reiterate the importance for developed countries to talce a leadership in ratifying the amendments of the Kyoto Protocol as early as possible. We once again urge all Parties to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible. Co-Chairs, we wish to ex\"'],\n",

The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. The decisions of Durban and Doha provide the mandate for the work of the ADP and the Group emphasizes that we need a balanced approach to our work. In the work of the ADP the leadership of developed countries is critical. Members of the G77 and China are prepared to do our part, developed parties need to demonstrate their leadership. The Group is also of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. Indeed, it should strengthen the multilateral rule-based regime in order for the Convention to achieve its ultimate objective. In addition, the Group of 77 and China applauds the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Our efforts should now be focused on bringing those amendments into effect at the earliest opportunity. We therefore urge all Parties to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible. Mr. Co-Chairs With those words you are assured of the Group cooperation and we are looking forward to engaging meaningfully with all our partners these two weeks. Thank you Mr. Chairman\"'],\n",

Mr. Co-Chairs, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from the Republic of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chairs, we came to Bonn determined to intensify our work, and we re-affirm our commitment to this objective. While we recognize the value of the open and frank exchange of views among Parties under the round-table format of last year, it is now time to shift gears. A single Contact Group should be established as soon as possible for each workstream so that transparency, inclusiveness and effectiveness are ensured and that clear decisions are adopted as to the structure and contents of the 2015 agreement due to come into force at the latest by 2020. Mr. Co-chairs, the 2015 agreement should be applicable to all Parties, respect the principles of the Convention, take into account the latest scientific information and include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by developed country Parties. Mr. Co-chairs, the current pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions presented by developed country Parties are far inadequate and insufficient. This is why the focus of the second contact group should be on identifying actions that can close the ambition gap with a view to ensuring that the highest possible mitigation efforts are undertaken by all Parties. Mr. Co-chairs, REDD+ has the potential to contribute more than 15 percent to the global mitigation solution. For this reason, REDD+ actions must assume a primary role in enhancing the level of ambition. To fulfill this objective and promote the contribution of REDD+ actions in achieving global emission reductions targets, developed countries should provide financial and technical support to developing countries with the aim to quantify the mitigation potential of REDD+ activities. Mr. Co-Chairs, we are ready, as usual, to cooperate with all Parties under your able leadership, with the view to finalize a robust and ambitious new regime for climate change before 2015. Thank you Mr. Co-chairs.\"'],\n",

Under the ADP decisions in Durban and Doha, we agreed to work towards a single, fair and comprehensive, legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties by 2015. We acknowledged the urgent need to close the pre-2020 mitigation gap to keep the below 2?C goal within reach. As we resume our work following the very positive and constructive engagement by all Parties in April, we agree with your assessment that the goals set out for that session were met. Now we need go one step further and urgently advance our work in order to fulfil the tasks we set ourselves in Durban - 2015 is around the comer. We must use this session to prepare for the outcomes we want to see in Warsaw. Key objective for the session Mr. co-Chairs, we fully support the goal of this session, set out in your informal note, to further focus our work in particular, by engaging on topics where differences can be bridged and where the common ground we ve identified can be further expanded. Under workstream one, we welcome the opportunity to further discuss the steps that we will need to take together to devise an agreement that includes mitigation commitments for all in such a way that is fair and reflects evolving economic realities and development opportunities for all Parties, consistent with the need to keep the global temperature increase below 2?C. The EU has recently made a submission that we hope provides ideas on how we could adopt an ambitious rules-based agreement in 2015. In addition to getting a clearer picture on the process going forward, we will need to elaborate on the elements of the 2015 agreement in order to facilitate movement towards the preparation of draft text at the end of 2014. We need to make progress on this in Bonn, and Warsaw needs to capture this progress. In this regard, we support the elements you have identified for discussion in the roundtables and we welcome also the workshop on adaptation in the 2015 agreement as a means of gaining clarity on what outcomes Parties might like to see on this important issue. We also welcome, and consider it appropriate at this joint session with the SBs, to look at how the 2015 agreement will connect with existing institutions under the KP and the Convention. The technical work being carried out in the SBs is vital to the on-going implementation of our agreements to date and will continue to be of significant importance in underpinning the elements of the 2015 agreement. It is important to build on what we have, but at the same time we must be efficient and not duplicate existing processes or institutions.

Mr. President, the SICA countries have expectations of the effectiveness of the Working Group of the Durban Platform for Expanded Action ADP) and we call for the establishment of a single contact group and not for the agenda of the ADP since this will allow us to systematically, effectively and purposefully follow up on the development of these negotiations. Our region is strongly committed to contributing to the achievement of concrete results of the ADP in its work agenda on the vision and ambition for mitigation, adaptation, financing, development and transfer of technology, transparency of action and the support and construction of capabilities. Mr. President, our region demands in these meetings to advance in the identification of options for a detailed framework of actions that can contribute to closing the pre-2020 ambition gap and the financial gap based on concrete commitments that demonstrate the leadership of developed countries. ; as well as the establishment of the central elements for the negotiating text to be considered during COP 20 The SICA countries consider it a priority that during these sessions the foundations are laid for an ambitious, lasting and effective agreement to be agreed in 2015, and that it reflects the necessary balance in adaptation and mitigation actions. The agreement should also facilitate support and flexibility in the face of different national circumstances and be based on transparency to verify compliance with commitments and financial contributions, especially by the countries in Annex 1. For our region, it is urgent to incorporate supervision, monitoring and verification mechanisms applicable to the commitments of implementing mitigation, financing, adaptation and technological transfer actions in Annex 1 countries. Mr. President, the ADP must work intensively to increase the level of ambition, especially of the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol for Annex 1 countries and to promote comparable voluntary efforts for developed countries that are not part of the Protocol. Likewise, within the framework of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the countries with the lowest historical responsibility for emissions must guarantee their right to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. In this sense, we highlight the need to have mechanisms that ensure the proper performance of institutional arrangements or an international mechanism for the recognition and compensation of losses and damages caused by climate change. Mr. President, our region has been promoting important national efforts and actions to reduce vulnerability to climate change and improve our adaptation capacities. Likewise, we have been investing our own resources to support the reduction of emissions with voluntary mitigation measures that should be valued as contributions to global efforts and to the level of ambition that we demand be increased by developed countries. The SICA countries in the face of the Post 2015 Agreement support the need to strengthen, improve and put into operation legally binding mechanisms for emissions reduction commitments and the adaptation of financial resources to implement adaptation and mitigation actions that guarantee us to maintain the temperature below 1.5 degrees C. In this sense, we make an urgent call to establish a roadmap on sustainable, predictable and additional financing for medium and long-term development aid, with goals for 2020 and post 2020 that support the efforts of the region. and from developing countries. At the same time, we consider that public financing should be given priority in this effort, promoting 2 private financing with social responsibility in a complementary way. Finally, the SICA countries before the Post 2020 Agreement-highlight the need for it to have solid mechanisms for supervision and monitoring of the provision of financing, so that they are appropriate to the level of commitments assumed by the parts that are developing countries. For these purposes, an efficient MRV mechanism must be adopted for the contribution of implementation medicines provided by developed countries, and thus all contribute to the fundamental objective of the convention and to be able to live in harmony with mother earth.

              "       ['21,2,2,2,20130604,eig,\"Mr. Co-Chair, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. As we all know, concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has surpassed 400 parts per million. In that sense the EIG reiterates that mitigation is a necessity and not a break to development but an opportunity for wellbeing. Mr. Co-Chair, we have no time to lose. The 2015 Agreement must provide a clear message to Parties and to the private actors that the future are low carbon economies, and establish robust and predictable legally binding mechanisms for action. Pre-2020 ambition is fundamental for the transformation into a low carbon future. Sufficient level of ambition needs political willingness and a fair and dynamic differentiation between Parties according to common but dfferentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Therefore, under workstream 1: we must particularly advance on the common understanding on fair differentiation under the Convention; the formulation of mitigation commitments by all Parties, including targets or actions; the process accompanying the formulation of commitments; and on internationally determined rules for accounting and transparency underlying these mitigation commitments; further, on the elements of the 2015 Agreement to empower Parties in the adaptation efforts; the design of the 2015 Agreement to catalyze means of implementation and climate friendly investments, ensuring both a fair burden sharing and targeted support for effective action to those who need such support; and finally, how to best build on the existing institutional arrangements in view of these elements; Mr. Co-Chair, we must urgently deliver on the commitments under the 2015 Agreement, but, at the same time, we must allow for sufficient time to determine the commitments in a meaningful manner, develop common underlying rules for accounting and MRV and get a clear understanding on the legally binding framework and timeframe in which the commmitments will be anchored. Under workstream 2: we have to recognize current action and encourage Parties to further engage in mitigation, through reduction potentials at national level as well as in the framework of international cooperation. Cooperative action at international level covers a wide range of actions and sectors able to involve all Parties. Further, the EIG would like to underline the importance of the other ongoing processes relevant for success under workstreams 1 and 2 of the ADP. This includes: the clarification of the 2020-pledges, supporting the needs for implementation and progress in the understanding and predictability of mobilisation of climate finance. Especially, the EIG countries emphasize the urgency of the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund. We are concerned and disappointed by the slow progress in this regard and urge to advance on the open issues by COP19. We have benefited from your wisdom, your supportive and clear leadership, and the constructive setting in which you have stirred our work. Mr Co-chairs, we all would like to thank you for this The informal round-tables and workshops have proven to be effective for the first part of our work at hand. At one moment, we may have to move into a different, more formal working modality, which is clearly reflecting the two distinct work streams through two formal working groups. It may well be that the COP in Warsaw may be the right movement for this step. On a final note, Mr Co-Chairs, the EIG would like to suggest to consider to suspend the ADP at this session and thus to allow the focused and productive work that we started in April to continue. We encourage you, Mr. Co-Chairs, to capture further progress achieved over the next two weeks in summaries, including outlining the areas of deepened common ground. Such organisation under the ADP will allow seemsless transition of the chairmenship to the new Co-Chairs to be elected here in Bonn. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chair\"'],\n",
              "       ['22,2,2,2,20130604,lmdc,\"Sudan has the honour to deliver this opening statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries in Climate Change LMDC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji. The group looks forward to continuing our work in the ADP. We must urgently act to address the climate change crisis and protect the integrity of Mother Earth under the Convention. Developing countries are well aware of this and are doing a large number of climate change mitigation and adaptation actions domestically to implement the Convention. Mr. Co-Chair You sent to Parties your informal notes on your perception and understanding of the discussions from the various roundtables at the first half of this session. Unfortunately, we have reservations on the annexes to the informal note. There was no engagement between or consensus among the Parties on these. There cannot be convergence on selective issues that portray a skewed picture of ADP progress. Convergence can be based on the ADP s mandate from Durban and Doha for enhanced action under the four main pillars of the Convention. Discussing these annexes will only distract us from moving forward in the ADP. The technical note of the Secretariat fai ls to fully capture the views of developing countries. This lack of balance concerns us. It cannot carry any legal weight in the ADP process or negotiations. Equitable and durable win-win-win solutions for the people, the climate, and sustainable development under the Convention cannot be achieved by wasting time discussing some new concepts and ideas deviating from, renegotiating, rewriting, replacing, restricting, and reinterpreting, the principles, provisions, and structure of the Convention. The ADP should instead advance its work through constructive, progressive, and positive engagement by all Parties in accordance with its mandate. On this, we wish to make three points: Mr. Co-Chair First, Workstreams I and 2 must have a balanced approach. Annex I Parties should immediately take the lead in showing pre-2020 ambition. Annex l KP Parties must immediately ratify the KP amendment for the 2nd commitment period, increase their QELROs substantially, and remove any conditions for doing so. Non-KP Annex 1 Parties should make comparable unconditional increases in their mitigation targets under the Bali Action Plan outcome. These should be done no later than April 2014. Annex II parties should also show increased ambition by fully financing mitigation projects, including those already in the CDM pipeline amounting to 6 gigatons of reductions), in developing countries regardless of the carbon price and without seeking to get emission reduction credits for doing so. A successful outcome in Workstream 2 in filling implementation gaps and increasing pre2020 ambition lays the basis for achieving future success in Workstream 1 for post-2020 enhanced action under the Convention. The selection of themes for the round tables and workshops must be balanced and comprehensive, and reflect the different elements within the two Workstreams. Specific themes are needed on enhanced provision of finance and on enhanced technology development and transfer, including removal of barriers. Themes that do not reflect the agreed elements of the Workstreams, such as investments and enabling environment for such investments, divert us from the problem of the inadequate provision of financing and technology from developed to developing countries under the Convention. Under Workstream 1, there should be workshops on enhancing the provision of the finance and technology support from developed countries to developing countries, and a roundtable on how developed countries take the lead after 2020. Under Workstream 2, the equity issue and increasing the pre-2020 ambition on finance and technology support from developed countries should also have workshops. We are concerned and find unacceptable those proposals which seek to discuss a selective list of issues as sectoral activities under Workstream 2, some of which imply imposing additional burdens on developing countries contrary to both the letter and spirit of the Convention. Any shift in approach in Workstream 2 away from the Convention approach, such as a result-oriented approach, endangers the process. It is only the Convention approach - where developed countries take the lead and support developing countries in implementing the Convention - that will give positive results. Mr. Co-Chair Second, the four pillars of the Convention must now be dealt with in a more organized and structured way, consistent with the mandate of the ADP from Durban and Doha. Both paragraph 5, decision 1 /CP.17, and paragraph 6, decision 2/CP.18, laid out the scope and the elements to be covered as part of the plan of work of the ADP under Workstream 1. These elements are: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building. We should focus on these existing common ground elements, and build on them as integral, comprehensive, holistic, and interlinked components of the outcome of the ADP by 201 S. Based on the four pillars of the Convention and the agreed elements from Durban and Doha, the ADP negotiations should address the following: enhanced Annex 1 mitigation commitments; enabled and supported non-Annex I nationally appropriate mitigation actions; enhanced action and support to adaptation in developing countries and an effective international mechanism on loss and damage; the enhanced provision of finance, including for technology development and transfer; enhanced technology access, transfer, and development, including through removal of barriers such as intellectual property rights; enhanced capacity building from developed countries to developing countries; forest activities, including through non-market-based mechanisms; effectively addressing the economic and social consequences of response measures on developing countries; and transparency and compliance. Mr. Co-Chair Third, process shapes and can affect the legitimacy and credibility of the outcome. The negotiations must be open, transparent, Party-driven, fully participatory, and provide mutual benefits for all. Enhanced developing country participation, including of LDCs and SIDS, in the process must be fully supported through additional funding. The negotiating approach, pace, and procedural and substantive progress of all issues and their elements must be appropriately sequenced and balanced, based on the four pillars of the Convention. The chairs of the Convention s other subsidiary bodies, including SBI, SBST A, GCF, SCF, TEC, CTCN, LTF, Adaptation Committee, should periodically brief the ADP. Finally, Co-Chairs, rest assured that our group, as individual Parties and as part of the Group of 77 and China, will continue to work constructively and positively with you at this session, your successors, and all Parties of the Convention.

Our group with satisfaction took a note of the results, of the April session, which facilitated intensive, open and constructive exchange of opinions, ideas and views. It is getting obvious that we should start to undertake our utmost, introduce radical measures which are grounded on existing principles and provisions and targeting the ultimate goal of the Convention, inter alia, decrease emissions of greenhouse gases and facilitate adaptation to climate change. Adaptation to climate change is a priority task to our group of countries due to high vulnerability of mountain ecosystems to climate change implications and their geographic location in the arid zone - with no access to the sea. The most vulnerable sectors for us are agriculture, water resources, natural ecosystems, biodiversity and hydroenergy. The Group called for an urgent and broader application of the ecosystem approach. As this approach, among other things, establishes favorable conditions to tackle uncertainties in running realistic forecasts of climate change implications and provides synergies with other global and regional environmental conventions. However the concerns with regard to availability of relevant funding for adaptation purposes still remain. Price reduction in the carbon market makes us search for other alternative sources for the Adaptation Fund, to enable access of other developing countries to the adaptation financial sources vis-a-vis the specificity and vulnerability of countries ecosystems. Regarding the Law Carbon development mountainous landlocked developing countries considers the common, but differentiate responsibility to be maintained given the different levels of historical responsibility and geographic and development specifics. Our group of countries with adequate financial and technical support from developed countries and following axiomatic and principles of the green economy are ready to take certain quantitative commitments not for reduction, but for limitation of the growth of greenhouse gas emissions relative to current emissions by gradually reducing the carbon intensity of GDP. Presently our countries are at the stage of formulation and approval of our national plans on adaptation, the national strategies and the plans of action, targeting the decrease of greenhouse gases emissions by 2015. The ecosystem approach in combination with concept of the green economy, adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Rio-de-Janeiro in June 2012, allows in many sectors to combine actions on mitigation with those on adaptation. This will significantly increase the effectiveness of actions to address climate change and therefore this approach deserves special attention and priority. Finally, our Group stands ready to work with all member countries with the mutual understanding and cooperation to reach our common goals. Thank you for your attention\"'],\n",

Thank you Co-Chairs, we greatly appreciate the leadership you have provided for the ADP over the last year. We feel that, under your guidance, the ADP has advanced its work, and there is a good basis for our work at CoP19 in Warsaw, this coming November. Co-Chairs, as Parties, we have reaffirmed that the 2015 Agreement is not an opportunity to renegotiate the Convention, its principles and annexes, but rather a time to define implementation beyond 2020. The Africa Group welcomes the reflections made, and conclusions drawn in respect of technical paper on adaptation, as an initial step towards the definition of global goal for adaptation. We would further emphasize the importance of science and equity as being central drivers for an effective agreement. Our efforts in the future agreement cannot be complete if we do not understand the implications of temperature goal on both adaptation and mitigation needs. We would further find it difficult to understand the required finance and technological needs to achieve the global effort. Co-Chairs, we request the Secretariat to arrange the revised technical paper on mitigation, based on reflecting the well-considered views by all Parties, that the actions towards mitigation ambition should reflect information on, - the applicability of the principles of the Convention, - the adaptation and mitigation benefits of actions, barriers and means of addressing them as well as incentives - finance, technology, and capacity building to support implementation. It is our view, that we have started engaging on the mitigation benefits, and considered barriers and incentives to these actions, but we have a lot of work to do in respect of the application of the Convention s principles and implementation support to these proposed initiatives. In conclusion Co-Chairs, the process to explore linkages with existing institutions of the Convention, and the work under the Subsidiary Bodies on finance and mitigation leadership by developed countries doe not only provide perspectives for the future agreement, but build the necessary trust and confidence as we negotiate the 2015 Agreement.

Let me first start by associating the Arab Group with the statement. The Arab group extends to you its full appreciation for the effective and cordial manner in which you have led our work for the past year. You have successfully steered our deliberations and promoted a constructive dialogue that will no doubt represent an important basis for the collective efforts to herald a new phase of the international climate regime. We do thank you for your leadership and we welcome the incoming co-chairs and wish them the best and commit to extend to them the same support and cooperation. Co-Chairs As we conclude this resumed second session of the ADP, the Arab Group reaffirms that the international climate regime is grounded on the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and of the KP. Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention represent the basis for international cooperation in the fight against climate change, namely through the principle of CBDR, equity, and the responsibility for historical emissions, and the absolute priority for developing countries to achieve sustainable development and pove1ty eradication in line with their national strategies and priorities. Our work in the ADP should not attempt to reinterpret or renegotiate the Convention principles, provisions, and structure, including its annexes, but instead should be grounded on them and they should be reemphasized in any 2015 outcome we reach. Co-chairs Our objective should be the full and sustained implementation of the Convention, through the full implementation of the outcomes emanating from the Bali processes and the Durban and Doha decisions. Our work in the ADP shall be informed, in particular, of the progress in implementation of the commitments made in Durban and Doha relative to the second commitment period of the KP and the implementation and delivery of com111itments in the areas of adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. We reaffirm that merely creating new institutions is not enough, but should be translated into concrete timebound deliverables for adaptation and mitigation. Co-Chairs The Arab Group believes that the 2015 outcome should not be mitigation-centered but should integrate all adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building, and transparency of actions and support. There is a need to bridge all the ambition gaps that presently exist with the same level of seriousness. We call for balance between the two ADP workstreams, and affirm that success in WS 2 is essential to instill a sense of trust and momentum for the success of W~ 1. Annex 1 countries members of the KP are called upon to urgently complete their ratification of the second commitment period, and revise their mitigation ambition upward in 2014. Non- KP Annex 1 countries or Annex 1 countries that chose not to be part of the second commitment period of the KP are called upon to exert comparable emission reduction efforts. We call on Annex 1 countries to take the lead in combating climate change and to fulfill their legal obligations to provide the means of implementation to developing countries. Like other developing countries groupings, the Arab group calls for equal emphasis be given to both mitigation and adaptation. We believe that any contribution by developing countries to the international mitigation effort must be nationally-determined and in the context of national circumstances, be grounded on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and not be to the detriment of their sustainable development priorities. We also support the request to examine the level of adaptation required for every temperature scenario and of the commensurate levels of finance and technology transfer needed by developing countries. In addition, we urge for swift progress in the operationalization of all the institutions created since Cancun, including in particular the Green Climate Fund. There is indeed an urgent need for a clear road map for achieving the goal of mobilizing 100 billion dollars per year from 2020, and for clarity on the level of finance between 2013 and 2020. The Arab group also calls on all sides to desist from unilateral trade measures in the name of climate change, and to effectively address the socio-economic impact of response measures on developing countries and assist those countries in need to diversify their economies in order to face the repercussions of climate change. Co-Chairs. The Arab Group will no doubt assume its fair share of the global efforts to combat climate change. Much is already taking place in individual Arab countries to delink their economic development strategies from the growth of their emissions and to implement new and renewable energy strategies. However, Arab countries will not agree with attempts to side-step the principles of the convention, or attempts by some to renege on their legal obligation and to shift their responsibilities to others. In closing, the Arab Group reiterates its commitment to work with all parties towards the success of our collective journey to 2015 so that its outcome responds to the aspirations of the international community, and to realize a shift in the mindset in these international negotiations away from finger pointing to a principled approach grounded on equity and fairness. thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['26,2,2,2,20130613,aosis,\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues: Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of 44 countries that are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS aligns itself with the statement, and the statements made by Nepal on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group and Swaziland on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs, once again, let me thank you for your leadership and congratulate you on a job well done. You have set the stage for us to make meaningful progress and we assure you and your successors of our continued support in the weeks and months ahead. Moving forward, our work must be guided by the knowledge that unless we dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term, well before 2020, the opportunity to keep global warming below the 1.5-degree threshold may be irrevocably lost. The deadly flooding unfolding here in Germany, as well as the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary is a graphic reminder of what is at stake at these negotiations and our hearts go out to all those impacted. But we remind the parties here that what is at stake for SIDS is existential; once the high watermark is reached for many of our small island nations and coastal communities these waters will never recede. Increasing our collective mitigation ambition is urgently needed. In light of this urgency, we submitted a proposal in line with our mandate from Durban under Workstream 2 to enhance mitigation ambition, to complement the negotiations with a more technical, concrete and collaborative process that creates a space for collective problem-solving. We welcome the constructive engagement of Parties on this new approach. In that light, we welcome the new call to Parties and other stakeholders to make submissions for a second version of the useful technical paper that provided the backdrop for our work in Workstream 2 here in Bonn. We encourage all relevant stakeholders to bring their mitigation strategies and ideas to this process. We have heard many countries underscore the obligation under the convention for developed countries to take the lead in this effort. Central to the AOSIS proposal is a call for developed countries to take the lead, first and foremost, by examining and exploiting their untapped mitigation potential at home through new policies and strategies. These should translate into more ambitious commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, bearing in mind the mechanism we agreed to in Doha to revisit and increase ambition, and would expect other comparably ambitious mitigation targets to come forward under the Convention by 2014 at the latest. We have heard many countries speak of the need to build trust between parties. We believe our proposed approach would do just that by creating a collaborative problem-solving effort where all countries explore the mitigation potential available, identify the actions they want to take and find solutions to make it happen. The process is not intended to create an opportunity for shifting the mitigation burden to developing countries, but it is an opportunity to overcome barriers to implementation, including the matching of enhanced means of implementation with mitigation actions developed in line with national sustainable development priorities, and making best use of the bodies and mechanisms we have developed under the Convention, in particular the GCF. Most importantly, we think this technical work should be undertaken in working groups in the opening days of COP19, and culminate in a Ministerial Roundtable on Enhancing Mitigation Ambition during our second week in Warsaw. Co-Chairs, we know that tackling climate change will require a sustained effort guided by the best science for generations to come. Therefore, Workstream 1 of the ADP must similarly ambitious and aimed at ensuring the survival of all our members. It is the view of AOSIS that the outcome of the process launched in Durban should be a Protocol under the Convention applicable to all Parties, to be adopted no later than 2015. As we continue to develop the core elements of the new legally binding agreement, we should build on the foundations of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, including their fundamental principles and provisions. The new legally binding agreement should strengthen the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, and ensure the survival of the most vulnerable. Being applicable to all, it will require universal participation and contributions from every Party. In addition, with the costs of climate change mounting before our eyes, it is absolutely essential to establish a mechanism to address Loss and Damage in Warsaw and ensure that this mechanism is also appropriately addressed in the context of the 2015 agreement. We urge the incoming Co-Chairs to move us to a more focused method of work in Warsaw so we can accelerate progress towards a new protocol, as our time is limited. For this reason, we welcome the call for at least one extra session to advance progress in 2014. Finally, we know that success here requires the attention and commitment of our leaders at the highest level. We see the UN Secretary-General Ban leaders summit in 2014 as an important decision point for Parties to raise ambition and meet our ultimate objective. Thank you.\"'],\n",

Co-Chairs, Thinking back on this time last year, we\\'d reflect on just how far we\\'ve come in our work under the ADP, under your guidance. The roundtables and workshops we\\'ve engaged in over the last year provided us with important building blocks for achieving, in 2015 a new agreement applicable to all Parties, and enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. All of us here know how important our mandate is - it is only by taking genuinely global action that we can deliver the objective of the Convention, and avoid real and severe consequences of climate change. Umbrella Group countries understand the role we have in continuing to lead this global endeavour, but meeting the Conventions objective will ultimately depend on ambitious contributions from fill countries. Our efforts must be based on working together. We value the collaborative spirit that Parties have brought to discussions in the ADP. This has helped us identify areas of common understanding and fruitful areas for further work, and as well as understanding areas of difference and potential ways to bridge these. We must continue this positive momentum. Between now and our next meeting in Warsaw, Parties have an opportunity to reflect on what they have heard here, and develop their thinking in greater depth. We encourage all Parties to take advantage of the invitation to prepare submissions, and put forward concrete ideas and proposals that can move work forward. At yesterdays informal plenary we heard a number of Parties identify themes for future work, building on potential common ground. We think this could include: For workstream 1: Elaborating the steps that will help Parties come forward with nationally determined mitigation commitments, that are clear, ambitious and fair Such as up-front transparency measures to ensure commitments are clear and predictable; A consultative process to consider ambition and fairness; And by further considering timing for proposing and considering commitments. We could further consider how a rule-based framework could be developed in a way that is applicable to all and incorporate mitigation efforts of all; We could draw out ideas on how adaptation, and measures to support and advance implementation, can be reflected in a 2015 package; and Have further exchanges on the structure of a 2015 agreement, including how it will interact with related decisions, institutions and infrastructure. For workstream 2, we could: Look further at how mitigation potential in a range of areas can be captured by Parties with diverse national circumstances; drawing on the lessons, practices and technical expertise that Parties and non-Party experts can share; Better understand what will allow Parties who have not yet made a 2020 pledge to do so; and enable higher ambition by those who have pledged; Encourage complementary work alongside the UNFCCC, through international co-operative initiatives, to drive practical action; And ensure that we continue to build and sustain political will and momentum. Warsaw will have a critical role to play in this regard. Umbrella Group countries would like to see focused Ministerial engagement on both workstreams at COP19. This would continue to strengthen the political foundation and direction of work in the ADP with a view to deliver in the agreed timeframe. But equally important will be the opportunity at COP19 to highlight the real action happening in and between countries on the ground. Demonstrating national and international action is what will let us successfully deliver the ADP s mandate. Co-Chairs, We cannot conclude without a final expression of gratitude to you both for your tireless efforts in leading the ADP, and helping us make the progress that we have made. We applaud you both. We also welcome and offer full support to our incoming Co-Chairs, and look forward to continuing the ADP s work under their stewardship. Thank you.\"'],\n",

In the same way we express our solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka to be living a similar situation. We understand the seriousness of the problem as this is a recurring situation in the SICA countries in the context of the high climatic variability that affects us, so we reiterate our call to the international community to redouble efforts to advance in decision-making to ensure reduce the impacts of climate change.

Mr. President, we require redoubled efforts by all Parties and urgently by developed countries to establish a framework of concrete commitments and actions to address the existing pre-2020 ambition gap and, especially, how to address the gap. financial that is necessary to promote these actions. At the same time, we need to maintain the objective of establishing the central elements of the negotiating text as soon as possible to be analyzed during COP20. An important step in building confidence is the prompt ratification of the second period of the Kyoto Protocol. The SICA countries express our commitment and availability to continue working to lay the foundations for an ambitious, long-lasting and effective 2015 agreement, which must reflect the balance between adaptation and mitigation actions and be flexible in the face of different national circumstances. This agreement must be based on transparency for the final Declaration of SICA-ADP, compliance with the commitments and financial contributions of the Annex 1 countries in matters of mitigation, financing, adaptation and technological transfer, applying mechanisms of supervision, monitoring and verification of the same. Mr. President, we consider that the work of the ADP must guarantee the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and in that sense, we call on Annex 1 countries to increase the level of ambition in the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol and voluntary efforts. comparable for developed countries that are not part of the Protocol. Likewise, we ratify the urgent need to advance in the constitution of an international mechanism for the recognition and compensation of losses and damages, caused by climate change according to the text of the decision adopted in this regard in Doha in such a way as to contribute to maintaining the right to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty in our countries. Mr. President, our region has as a priority to promote national actions for vulnerability reduction and adaptation; however, they have also been systematically promoting voluntary mitigation measures in different sectors and with their own resources, which should be valued as contributions to global efforts to reduce emissions and to the level of ambition that we demand be increased by the countries developed. The countries of SICA demand the need to put in place legally binding mechanisms for emissions reduction commitments that seek to keep the temperature below 1.5 degrees and we require the establishment of a road map before the Post 2015 Agreement. , especially in relation to public financing that must be sustainable, predictable and additional to official development aid. We require concrete goals by 2020 and post 2020 that support the implementation of mitigation actions and the adaptation efforts of our countries. Finally, Mr. President, our countries in relation to the Post 2020 Agreement, express the need for it to have an adequate and effective supervision, monitoring, reporting and verification mechanisms regarding financing and the contribution of means of implementation. that they be provided to developing countries by developed countries and thereby guarantee the necessary efforts to achieve the central objective of the Convention of reducing the harmful impacts of climate change on human activities.

In this regard, the Group of 77 and China appreciates your efforts Co-Chairs, in guiding and facilitating the work of the ADP in a transparent and inclusive manner. On behalf of the Group, I would like to convey our thanks to you, the current Co-Chairs, and, looking ahead, to assure the incoming Co-Chairs, of the Groups continued cooperation and support. The Group of 77 and China believes, however, that much remains to be done. To that end, the Group concurs on the need to convene, in addition to the SBI, SBSTA and COP sessions, at least two more sessions in 2014. In this regard, the Group supports the request to the Secretariat to make the necessary arrangements. The Group of 77 and China strongly believes that the decisions of Durban and Doha provide the mandate for the work of the ADP. In workstream one including inter alia on Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology Development and Transfer, Transparency of Actions and Support, and Capacity Building. On workstream two, on a work plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to identify and to explore options for a range of actions that can close the ambition gap with a view to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts by all Parties. We also underline the high priority that the Group attaches to enhancing actions on adaptation and means of implementation in the work of the ADP. The Group further believes that the work should progress in a more focused and Party, driven mode in Warsaw, and stresses the need to maintain a balance, both in terms of content and progress of the work, in both work, streams. To this end, the Group of 77 and China believes that the six points identified as the Group s position on ADP at the April session remain relevant and bear repeating; i. The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles, and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; ii. The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; iii. The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; iv. The negotiations under the ADP must be a party-driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; v. The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and vi. Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. We look forward to the two technical papers to be prepared by the Secretariat to inform the further work of the ADP. In the work of the ADP under work, stream, the leadership of developed countries is critical. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China expects that the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol enter into force as soon as possible. We therefore urge all Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible, and to increase their mitigation ambition by 2014. We likewise expect non-KP Annex 1 Parties to increase their mitigation ambition in a comparable manner. Members of the Group of 77 and China are already doing their part and prepared to do more, but developed parties need to demonstrate their leadership. The Group is of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. Indeed, it should strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime in order for the Convention to achieve its ultimate objective. Recognizing the importance of the work of other subsidiary bodies for progress in this working group, the Group of 77 and China wishes to express its disappointment and deep concern at the inability of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to begin the work of its 38th session. This delay has the potential to profoundly impact the progress of the work under the ADP. The Group of 77 and China calls on the Chair of the SBI, relevant bodies under the Convention and Parties to resolve this impasse prior to the start of the 39th session of the SBI.

I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, its 27 Member States and Croatia. We have had good exchanges during the session, building on the spirit of positive engagement of our ADP meeting last month. In particular on workstream 1, we have had further discussions on the steps we need to take to get us from where we are now to adopting by 2015 a single, fair and comprehensive, legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties. The new agreement should be durable and dynamic, capable of evolving and facilitating strengthened action over time to enable us to meet our below 2?C goal. In particular, through the roundtables and workshops Parties have been able to discuss in more detail their ideas and share their expectations. They have emphasised the importance of upfront clarity regarding proposed mitigation commitments; the need for a period to assess whether commitments are individually fair and collectively ambitious enough; and the importance of adaptation and means of implementation. The time to 2015 is short and we must move forward with a sense of urgency. On Workstream 2, we have acknowledged the urgent need to close the pre-2020 mitigation gap to keep the below 2?C goal within reach. We consider that the format of this session has allowed us to have more focussed discussions and get a deeper understanding of each other\\x19s positions. Parties have again shared experiences, good practice examples, identified opportunities and barriers and we have heard from external organisations and initiatives as well as considering the Secretariat technical paper. We have heard proposals building on the themes identified in the technical paper based on Parties\\x19 contributions with the aim of providing an input to Ministerial level discussions on mitigation ambition in Warsaw. Our discussions here have provided much food for thought on both workstreams and we must take time to think and consider how we each can move forward towards Warsaw. As we have said previously, at COP 19 we want to achieve strong deliverables on implementation, substantive and tangible progress on pre-2020 ambition, and a clear pathway for adopting an ambitious legally binding Agreement in 2015. The format of roundtables and workshops has served us well and we would like to see that kind of engagement continue at COP19 alongside any move to a more formal mode. The work we have agreed to undertake between now and Warsaw will be useful to feed into Ministerial level discussions on both workstreams that will deliver the political engagement we need. On Workstream 1, we want to see decisions that capture progress on the scope, structure and design of the 2015 agreement as well as the process to deliver it. On workstream two we need a decision that sets out the need for new pledges; increasing the ambitio\"'],\n",

We associate ourselves with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of G77 and China, by Swaziland on behalf of the Africa Group and by Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. Our 850 million people are among the most exposed, the most vulnerable, and the least able to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. In the recent months, reports and researches have clearly shown that our planet is on track for a four-degree temperature increase by the end of the 21st century. This will have detrimental and disruptive consequences on our livelihoods, economies and ecosystems. Co-chairs the related decrease in crop production and water availability, or the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, have the potential to roll back decades of development and trap our populations in hardship and extreme poverty. It is our common responsibility to prevent the adverse impacts of climate change. Only an equitable, ambitious and effective protocol, to be adopted in 2015, will have the potential to ensure the survival of the most vulnerable including women and children, and promote access to sustainable growth for all. Significant progress has been made during these two weeks. However, divergences persist and they should be dealt with in a constructive manner to achieve our mandate under the decision 1/CP17. For this, we need to move forward to more focused mode of negotiations. Our group urges the negotiating text to be available by the end of the COP20. Further engagement of Parties is needed under Workstream 1 to anchor all the elements for defining the overall architecture of the 2015 agreement, which should cover: mitigation, consistent with limiting warming to 1.5??C; enhanced action on adaptation; loss and damage; finance; technology; capacity building; transparency of actions and support. Co-chairs we reiterate that the 2015 agreement should be based on science and equity. Workstream 2 calls for urgency and concrete actions starting in 2014. We call for rapidly enhanced mitigation actions under the leadership of developed countries. Together with this, ambition by developing countries should be triggered by appropriate means of implementation. Co-chairs, we thank you for your leadership and job well done. We look forward to your final note, reflecting the progress achieved to date. This will be valuable for laying a solid foundation for further progress of ADP.

Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from the Republic of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chair, at the outset let me express our appreciation for your dedication as co-chairs. You have set the bar high, thankfully, and we are on solid ground for future work. Mr. Co-chair, the agreement to be reached by 2015 should be applicable to all Parties, be Party driven, be underpinned by the best science, and be based on the principles of the Convention. Further, it should be adequately informed by the work of other bodies under the Convention and include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by a broad variety of financing sources, with a leading role by developed country Parties. Mr. Co-chair, on the pre-2020 ambition track we again call for developed country Parties to assume leadership by increasing and enhancing their greenhouse gas reduction commitments, as required by the Convention. Developing country Parties, in particular rainforest nations, are prepared to contribute significantly to the fight against climate change. Mr. Co-chair, REDD+ has the potential to contribute significantly to the mitigation gap that all of humanity must achieve. To make this happen, new and additional financial and technical support for the implementation of REDD+ activities should be provided by developed country Parties so that REDD+ countries can voluntarily and meaningfully contribute to the emission reductions demanded by the latest science. Mr. Co-chair, on the way forward to Warsaw we appreciate the value of the open and frank exchange of views among Parties under the round-table format. Furthermore, we feel that it will allow Parties under the new co-chairs to undertake a more focused mode of work under a Contact Group format as of the next meeting. Mr. Co-chair, we must start to engage in direct negotiations as soon as possible. The 2015 deadline for the envisaged legally binding agreement must not be missed for any reason. Therefore, we support the call for at least one additional session to be held in 2014. Finally Mr. Co-Chair, let me assure you that the Coalition is ready and keen to continue working and engaging with all Parties in this process so that a new and ambitious, global climate change agreement is established by 2015.

              "       ['33,2,2,2,20130613,lmdc,\"Pakistan has the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji on behalf of G77 & China. As we conclude our work here in Bonn and move towards COP-19 in Warsaw, we would like to share our perspectives on the ongoing work of the ADP and how we perceive it should progress in the coming 2 years. First and foremost, allow us to extend our gratitude to you Co-Chairs for your wise leadership of this process so far. Your perceptive stewardship of the ADP has enabled it to start on a good and positive note. Through your inclusive and transparent consultations and an open-ended informal organization of work, you have enabled the Parties to have a better understanding of each others positions. You guided the process when mutual confidence and understanding were needed and you listened to what the Parties wanted, even when we sometimes disagreed with you. We appreciate your efforts and your inclusivity. We hope the spirit of openness, transparency, inclusivity, fairness and party-driven approach that you have fostered in this group would abide in the coming two years. We also take this opportunity to welcome our new co-Chairs and we look forward to working with them. Mr. Co-Chairs, the group of like-minded developing countries has engaged in a spirit of urgency and .solid?rity in the work of the ADP. Our engagement is premised on enabling enhanced action on the implementation of the Convention. This is our mandate in the ADP. The developing countries are doing their part. We are doing so even as we bear the disproportionate burden of the impacts of climate change and continue to struggle with the challenges. of poverty eradication and achieving sustainable development. We therefore call on others to also do their part in fully implementing their commitments under the Convention, particularly developed countries who have long been expected to take the lead in this effort due to their historical responsibi lity and their capabilities. We hope that this expectation wi ll finally be realized as a result of our work here in the ADP. Secondly, even as we confront the unprecedented urgency of the challenge of climate change, we are equally conscious that we did not initiate this new process to renegotiate, replace, rewrite or restructure the Convention or to reinterpret its principles, provisions and structure. This understanding is fundamental to our group and we would challenge any effort that seeks to undermine the Convention or its principles and provisions. The mandate of the ADP is to enhance the implementation of the Convention not to reinterpret it. Needless to add, the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities are bedrock of our work and must be fully respected in he process as well as the outcome of the work under the ADP. Thirdly, as we move into COP-19 and beyond, we must now seek to focus our work on the Convention s four pillars for enhanced action, i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and the two other elements that we have all agreed to, i.e. capacity building and transparency of action and support, which are also related to the four main pillars. It is also time that we move into a more structured and formal organization of work bui lt around these pillars as integral and interlinked components of the final outcome of the ADP. We hope the incoming Co-Chairs will present us with a work programme on these lines. Fourthly, we would need to continue to ensure that there is balance in our work - balance between the two workstreams and in particular the elements within. them. While the timeframe for our action under the two workstreams may be different, the template of our action is common. This template must be based on the four Convention pillars of mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology transfer. We must ensure balance among them in both the workstreams. Fifth, developed countries must demonstrate their lead in enhancing their ambition in both the pre as well as post-2020 periods and not just in mitigation alone. Ambition must be enhanced in the provision of finance and technology to developing countries which is crucial for them to do more. Together with other developing countries from AOSIS, LDCs, and African Group, we call on the developed countries to increase their pre-2020 mitigation ambition by 2014 to at least 40 below 1990 levels. Developed Countries must also take the lead in modifying longer-term trends in their anthropogenic emissions by adopting more sustainable lifestyles and hence providing useful experiences in sustainable development for developing countries. Sixth, talking of mitigation, it is extremely important that we stick to the letter and spirit of the Convention. We have heard various proposals and models on burden-sharing. We are apprehensive of these proposals because they obfuscate differentiated responsibilities, and emphasize only common responsibilities. This goes against the interests of developing countries and also violates the grain of the Convention. Seventh, we remain cautious regarding many proposals on mitigation in the pre-2020 period. Such selective Sectoral activities must not have the effect of imposing additional burdens on developing countries. Activities and initiatives such as on HFCs or energy must be under the Convention ~nd fully respect Convention principles. The intense sensitivities of developing countries on the issue of agriculture, on which millions of poor farmers depend for their subsistence and livelihood, must be respected. Mr. Co-Chairs, we remain concerned with the lack of political will to meaningfully operationalize the instruments we have created on finance and technology. We cannot let them be empty shells. The output of these institutions will be a key basis of our actions in the post-2020 period and as such they must live up to the high expectations we have of them. A clear roadmap for developed countries to fulfill their financial support in the period of 2013 to 2020 in order to meet the goal of providing $100 billion dollars per year by 2020 and address barriers to technology transfer including IPRs must form part of our discussions under ADP Workstream II. Finally Mr. Co-Chair, we would like to underline the importance the group attaches to continued and enhanced work on Adaptation under the Convention as a result of the work of the ADP in both workstreams. The developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change which increases our adaptation costs and creates more challenges to our sustainable development. As such, we strongly support the proposal for a technical paper by the Secretariat on Adaptation. Mr. Co-Chairs, the group of like-minded developing countries will continue to engage proactively and ??positively with this process. You and your successors can count on our support to craft a truly ambitious, comprehensive, fair and equitable multilateral response to climate change under the Durban Platform. Thank you.\"'],\n",

Let us - partner and endorse, the statement made by Fiji on behalf of G77 + China and Pakistan on behalf of the Group of Developing Countries with LMDC thinking. We would like to acknowledge that although the work under the Ad Hoc Group on the Durban Platform is in process, there is still much to do and we must do it in a more efficient and concrete way than we have done so far. In a more formal and structured way, including the creation of a contact group. We should thank you as co-chairs for making the best attempt to lead this process in a wise, transparent and inclusive way that has allowed us to have a better understanding of the discussions, and it is precisely this understanding that we want to share with you today. ALBA enthusiastically appreciates the election of Venezuela through Miss Di Carlo as Rapporteur of the ADP Co-presidents, It is our duty as active participants in this multilateral process, to share with concerns and considerations for the future of our work. We must emphasize that work should be concentrated in light of the Convention and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. There can be no case in which we forget that the improved implementation of the Convention is based on something as simple as fulfilling the existing commitments ALREADY contemplated in this document. We, as developing countries, do this, and unfortunately we feel that we carry a disproportionate weight due to the lack of leadership of developed countries. We have hoped and insisted that this leadership be reflected, that the difference in capabilities be translated into actions that correspond to this situation and to these commitments. We are aware that ADP represents a new process. But an instrument, agreement or protocol with legal force under the Convention cannot rewrite it. We must close the gap, YES. But we must recognize that there are several gaps, not just one mitigation gap. There are financing gaps, adaptation gaps, technology development and transfer gaps, capacity development, and means of implementation. ALL of these are GAPS and I have not had any workshops or round tables that suggest closing them or treating them frankly. Finally, on the issue of Equity, we have all recognized that Equity must be a central element of the 2015 result, but we are not exploring the fact that we do not understand equity in the same way. Some think that equity means treating everyone as equal, regardless of their circumstances or precedents and across generations. This is NOT fairness between co-chairs and is not a concept that can be sustained or will stand the test of time. Equity must consider the circumstances of the Parties, their situations and realities, their capacities and responsibilities, the intergenerational effects and THE PRINCIPLES AND PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION. THAT ..... that is equity and it is an element that must be considered in the work of BOTH work routes and that must be reflected in the work we do under this regime before 2020 and after 2020 alike. We will not be able to work from a technical point of view only. The technical is subject to the guidance and political will of the parties, in good faith and the desire to work. Our work will be irrelevant if we do not reflect what the world expects of us, if we do not allow ourselves to establish the financial, technological, and technical instruments that make it possible to operationalize the commitments of the Convention. Without political will, willingness to cooperate and move forward, we will again be very disappointed. For both Mr. President, it is our interest to clearly state that significant progress at COP 19 depends on 3 critical elements: Completion of the ratification process of the amendment to the Kyoto Protocol - Establishment of ranges of mitigation objectives for countries Annex 1 - Specification of sources and objectives of financing for 2012, 2015 and thereafter. With these questions we depart from Bonn and we hope that the true political will to face Climate Change will be demonstrated to meet the demand of our peoples. Ladies and Gentlemen, without a doubt, the political will for ALBA s constructive work is guaranteed. Thank you, co-chairs.\"'],\n",

We celebrate that we were able to progress in the substance of our discussions in such a positive environment, and that we stood by the consensus reached in Doha to engage in a more focused and substantive work. AILAC would like to insist in the importance of standing by our agenda, reached as a balanced and delicate compromise between all parties. This agenda.should continue to lead our work through the following sessions of the ADP, be it in potential additional sessions in this semester or directly at COP 19 in Warsaw and beyond. We believe that we should continue to engage in this positive environment and we therefore would call for suspending the current session. A steady and swift transition for the incoming co-Chairs will secure as well the required continuity of our work, which is fundamental for a successful outcome under both workstreams. Meaningful progress under both workstreams is essential. Given that the 2015 agreement is applicable to all parties, AILAC welcomes the growing willingness of all parties to contribute through action towards achieving the ultimate goal of the Convention. AILAC believes there needs to be an adequate balance between the ability of the 2015 agreement to secure universal participation, considering national circumstances, while delivering environmental integrity according to science. In this regard, the 2015 agreement needs to be tailored not to accommodate specific parties, but to secure the achievement of the 2C goal. Warsaw is a fundamental milestone that should capture concrete progress of our focused work. A Warsaw decision should outline the substance and elements that will structure the 2015 agreement. This outline should enable us to timely deliver a draft text for the agreement as provided in the Doha decision, in May 2015. Elements of this outline should include in our view: 1. Common rules based system for accounting and MRV to ensure comparability of efforts and environmental integrity in the context of CBDRRC. A system for nationally determined contributions towards the global goal, including mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation in the context of climate action, Action on adaptation is at the core of the 2015 agreement, and shall be considered in a balanced manner. We need to build upon the current institutions under the Convention, but also go beyond the status-quo by giving adaptation a space in the agreement that is equally important as the space for mitigation. The new agreement should provide for funding and incentives that operationalize not only planning for increased resil ience but for actual implementation of adaptation actions. The less we mitigate, the less able we are to adapt. The less we adapt, the less we are able to mitigate. The linkage is evident. Science tells us, that if mitigation efforts are not sufficient to guarantee environmental integrity, we will be facing a situation where adaptation will not only be more costly, but also hardly possible. Some of our countries are already suffering irreversible impacts that threaten our livelihoods and opportunities for sustainable development. In this context, AILAC believes that loss and damage will need to be addressed in the new 2015 agreement. Finance, technology transfer and capacity building are necessary to enable all parties to implement adaptation and mitigation action on the ground, a necessity to make climate action a reality. Means of implementation cannot be discussed in a vacuum, but in a focused and concrete manner that relates to action and understanding the particularities of what is required in order to move from planning to implementing and achieving successful results in adaptation and mitigation. Innovative work on addressing these issues, needs to be launched now and develop as promptly and extensively as the undergoing development of mitigation efforts. A process for timely ex-ante review, that effectively allows parties to deliver their highest possible effort and do their fair share considering equity and science, to ensure both climate justice and environmental integrity of our response to climate change. The expected outcome of such a process would be to allow parties to find the appropriate level of effort through adequate incentives and windows of opportunity. Peers, scientific experts, and civil society should be able to play a role in such a process. A dynamic and iterative assessment mechanism, applicable to all parties, that allows us to adjust our commitments regularly and to enhance ambition towards the 22C goal, in accordance with our differentiated capabilities and responsibilities; If we are to translate our agreements into positive and real impacts in the implementation of the Convention and the achievement of its ultimate objective, we need to ensure that we all deliver on what we will commit to. Hence, a robust and effective compliance mechanism must be adequately designed and built in the 2015 agreement. This mechanism should include both incentives and sanctions as tools for accountability. Work under this workstream is a priority towards closing the mitigation ambition gap pre-2020. Inputs we consider catalytic for increased ambition pre-2020 have been put forward by parties and expert bodies. We should start building upon them. Energy was a good starting point as a sector that has a high mitigation potential and also represents a good opportunity for low carbon development with many significant co benefits. We look forward to ideas from parties on ways to engage in other equally relevant sectors. Further work needs to be done on providing spaces for existing UNFCCC bodies and institutions to contribute in creating an adequate environment for all parties to enhance their efforts pre 2020, including new pledges, and moving to the upper end of the existing ones. We also need to make WS2 a useful tool for all parties to prepare domestically and consider together operational ways to lift barriers to increasing ambition, including the pressing need for developed country parties to take the lead ratchet up their mitigation and support pledges, as well as developing country parties that have not yet voluntarily put forward their contributions do so. This is the only way we see forward, if we are-to timely close the mitigation ambition gap. There have been proposals for Ministerial engagement on WS2 in Warsaw, which would help us build the necessary political momentum to increase ambition and to reach decisions at COP 19 and COP 20 that capture pre 2020 ambition.\"'],\n",
              "       ['36,2,2,2,20130613,eig,\"thanks the Co-Chairs for excellent work: guided wisely the work under the ADP, keeping us on our toes, and always in good humour. EIG believes we have made some progess at this session - we have furthered common ground and a better understanding on the areas we still need to engage on as the next steps. Indeed, further progress is urgently needed to adopt in 2015 an agreement for post-2020 and to increase ambition before 2020. And, Mr. Co-Chairs, in order to allow us to progress efficiently, we would strongly benefit from a progress report from you in which, under your authority, you summarize our discussions and the perceived common ground. The increasingly focused discussions in Round Tables and Workshop have helped to advance our understanding of important concepts and possible elements of the future regime. Mr. Chairmen, we all will benefit for further interaction in this nonnegotiating setting to further develop and deepen common ground on concepts. But Warsaw may well be the moment to move at the same time, i.e, in parallel to continuing common thinking in roundtable and workshop format, also into a more formal mode in order to capture in a decision the progress achieved so far and outline the next steps that we have to take. Mr. Co-chairs, on WS1: a decision in Warsaw is needed expanding our common understanding on the core elements of the 2015 Agreement, including that each Party will determine a quantifiable mitigation commitment, including targets or actions, as a fair contribution to the 2 objective; on the willingness and need to support this national determination through international guidance and discussion on fair differentiation and equity; on the modalities of the mitigation commitments, including the underlying rules and the needed ex-ante clarity; on the modalities of the process and the timing of determining and anchoring commitments; and on the elements of the agreement including time frame and structure. Thus, two steps are needed in Warsaw to allow us to progress: agreeing on what elements will have to be further developed and agreeing to initiate concrete work on these elements. In Warsaw, we will also have to further deepen our understanding on the elements of the 2015 Agreement to empower Parties in their adaptation efforts. And, we will have to progress in our understanding how the 2015 Agreement will catalyze means of implementation, including by increasing effectivity to address finance, technology and capacity needs. Mr. Co-Chairs, on WS2: Warsaw will be the moment for those Parties who have not yet submitted pledges to do so. In addition, we should continue and further deepen our common analysis of the mitigation potential. This will require an even more technical exchange. And this will create the good basis for a ministerial dialogue on increasing mitigation ambition prior to 2020. And, we will have to develop a better common understanding how initiatives outside of the UNFCCC can contribute to an increase in ambition. We should stimulate and support such initiatives, such as reforming fossil fuel subsidy policies. We should develop a good understanding of how these initiative reduce emissions, and we should acknowledge them as efforts to increase ambition. Mr. Co-chairs, you have given us a lot. Your wisdom, your commitment, your stimulation, your humour and your solution oriented, non-ideological, pragmatic and at the same time ambitious and visionary approach has helped us to so successfully advance in the first phases of ADP. With you, we have achieved more than many thought possible. But let us not only thank you with nice words, but by building on what you have helped us achieve so far and by delivering by 2015 an effective, fair, robust, and at the same time future proof and dynamic legally binding instrument to hold global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. Thank you \"'],\n",

Co-Chairs, first we would like to extend our message of congratulations on your selection as the new Co-Chairs of the ADP. We would like to pledge our commitment to supporting you achieve the objectives of the Convention and the ADP at this critical time. We thanks the Polish Government and its people for the wonderful hospitality, facilitation and arrangements made to make this conference a success. We also like to thank the secretariat for their support. Co-Chairs, let me reiterate the inclusiveness of the Durban agreement and call for our approach to be balanced as we move forward. Particularly, we would like to support a balanced approach to workstream I and II. In our view, agreements reached under workstream II provides confidence and trust building measures for workstream 1. The Africa Group recognizes the need to start engaging more robustly, as we have a deadline for December 4014 for elements of the draft negotiating text. We also need to build our technical understanding on very important issues such the Global Goal for Adaptation, as well as the science and equity considerations in the 2015 Agreement We call for adaptation to be central to the agreement, with clear commitments for Annex II Parties towards adaptation, reflected in an Adaptation Goal. We support the Co-Chairs proposal for Parties to start engaging with each other, and the Africa Group submit that there 5 areas of negotiation that can help us in structuring the negotiation. First, General Commitments, based on the temperature goal to define the required global action. Second, specific commitments, differentiated for Parties covering mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology. Third, transparency and accountability provisions, building on Bali Action Plan and KP mechanisms. Fourth, defining of the role of operationa1 mechanisrns already established under the Convention. Fifth, matching of science to the country driven approach of pledges in Warsaw; we must take decisions that concretise elements that have been agreed, so as to facilitate implementation of climate action pre 2020. As a Group we are cautious about initiatives mat take attention away from Annex I raising their ambition pre 2020, by emphasizing processes for post 2021. Commitments by proponents of international cooperative initiatives need clear rules, finance provisions and recognition of the objective of the Convention. The need for an adequacy discussion prior to inscription of commitments, with such a discussion including mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. We also look forward to supporting you and engaging on some of the outputs currently on the table such as the Adaptation Technical Paper and the review of operational mechanisms and institutions under the Convention.

We have the willingness to act and remain at your disposal for Ideas, available to enhance our ambition and to lead with example; Second, In this spirit, we believe the purpose of the ADP should be focused in enhancing action for achieving the 1.5-2C global goal, that is to say to fulfill the ultimate objective of the Convention; Third, we agree that our work is not in a vacuum, but is oriented by all the work carried on under the Convention, previous decisions, and directed to its ultimate goal with guidance of the Convention s principles; Fourth, we all have something to contribute to this end. AILAC is and will continue Its efforts to contribute. We are ready to dive deeper into defining concrete elements of the basis of the 2015 agreement, in particular on adaptation, finance and transparency of action and support; Fifth.

Firstly, we associate this intervention with that made by the Distinguished delegate of Fiji, in his capacity as President of the Group of 77 and China and by Venezuela on behalf of the Group of like-minded countries. We want to express our solidarity with the people of the Philippines for the tragedy they have suffered. Mr. President. The responsibility of the Durban Platform Working Group is fundamental to resolve the urgent need to provide solutions to the climate crisis with a Work Program applicable before 2020 and a binding legal instrument that comes into effect after 2020 that Understand all core topics in a comprehensive and balanced way. The instrument to be agreed in 2015 and put into effect from 2020 must fully respond to the principles and provisions of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. The very serious events that many peoples of the world are suffering due to the impacts of extreme events caused by climate change, as is the case of the Philippines, demand urgent and drastic solutions. It is not fair that the peoples that are not the cause of climate change pay so severely for its consequences. For this reason, we must express, Mr. President, that we are concerned that despite the worrisome prognoses of temperature increase, sea level rise and more frequent and serious occurrence of extreme events, developed countries are not taking the lead in the performance of mitigation actions. Mr. President, precisely in order to build agreements, it is urgently necessary to provide the necessary means of implementation and financial resources so that mitigation and adaptation actions can be carried out in developing countries and that developed countries significantly increase their ambitions to reduce emissions. Both the Work Program and the new legal instrument applicable after 2020 must be in full compliance with the Convention. A system cannot be implemented that standardizes the obligations to all parties as if they were all the same. The principle ? of common but differentiated responsibility establishes that we have different historical responsibilities in global warming ? and, consequently, it is up to developed countries to implement ambitious actions and commitments expressed in a quantified way. That it is not intended to transfer these responsibilities to the developing countries. The developed countries should take the lead in the realization of commitments of mitigation and the developing countries we must carry out mitigation actions within the framework of compliance with Article 4.7 of the Convention, that is, with full compliance with the provision of means of implementation. Adaptation is one of the central issues for developing countries; however, this issue has not received adequate and sufficient attention from: developed countries. The adaptation institutional framework must be strengthened and must have new and additional financing for its operation. On the other hand, adaptation plans of developing countries must be fully supported by financial means, capacity building and the transfer of necessary technology. Financing must be of a public nature. That it is not intended to convert the post 2020 legal instrument or the pre-2020 action program into opportunities for make climate change a lucrative business without effective solutions for the effects of climate change, replacing the obligation of developed countries to provide public resources with bank loans, carbon markets, disaster risk insurance, private investments, etc. Climate change is not a business opportunity, it is a risk that endangers humanity, the risks of life and of Mother Earth cannot be commercialized. The Climate Change Convention is not a market convention. Developed countries must provide a significant percentage of their PIS annually within the framework of their historical responsibility so that developing countries carry out adaptation and mitigation actions.

Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS associates itself with the statement made by Fiji on behalf the Group of 77 and China, and the statements made by Nepal on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group and Swaziland on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs. At the outset, let me also welcome you to your first session as co-chairs of this important working group and thank you for the leadership you have already demonstrated. I assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work to close the emissions gap and work towards a 2015 agreement. The time we have to act is rapidly slipping away for.the members of our group. The latest lPCC review confirms that unless urgent and dramatic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, the opportunity to avoid catastrophic global warming in excess of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels could be irrevocably lost While the UNEP gap report reminds us that taking the action required remains entirely technically and economically feasible, but only if parties increase ambition and achieve real emissions reduction beyond current pledges. Co-Chairs, We have agreed to organize our discussions into two separate workstreams and it is important that both be allocated adequate time here in Warsaw. Both Workstreams must be driven by a sense of urgency, mindful that a failure to act decisively now will only require a more reactive and vastly more expensive response later. Failure to close the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap will have profound implications for the scale and natl.ire of obligations under the 2015 protocol. To that end, AOSIS has submitted a plan under ADP Workstream 2 that would complement negotiations on the 2015 agreement with a new, truly collaborative technical process focused squarely on assessing the most promising mitigation opportunities and identifying strategies to overcome the obstacles that have prevented their wider implementation. In fact, we have brought renewable energy experts from each of our member regions-the Caribbean, AIMS, and Pacific regions-to Warsaw, so they can share success stories about the exciting work that is happening in their countries Stories of our collective efforts and experiences, should inform the discussions. of the ADP ministerial meeting with a view to adopting a decision on a detailed action plan for 2014 under Workstream 2. We must have sufficient time allocated to Workstream 1 at the ministerial meeting and in the ADP negotiations to reach an ambitious outcome. We have been consulting extensively with parties and look forward to discussing the details of our proposal in the coming days. We will also continue to encourage Parties to raise the ambition of their 2020 pledges, or to come forward with new pledges for those who have not yet done so. Co-chairs, We must also make progress under Workstream 1 and continue to build on the foundation of the Convention, and all its principles and provisions. The fact that we are now negotiating a new protocol under the Convention does not relieve developed countries of their responsibility to take the lead in addressing climate change. There cannot be any backslide in the type, nature, or ambition of their mitigation commitments under the 2015 agreement. The outcome of the ADP Workstream 1 should be a legally binding Protocol under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties and adopted no later than 2015. The safety, viability and survival of our members demands that the agreement be based on science and therefore include a global goal of keeping global warming well below 1.5 degrees. The alarming impacts of climate change that are unfolding before our eyes are all the more tragic because so many solutions ate within reach. We thus called developed countries to fulfill their longstanding commitments to provide the finance and technology needed to address climate change and its unnecessary impacts once and for all. We also need an ambitious and balanced outcome in the other areas mandated in the Durban Platform adaptation, finance, technology transfer and development, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. Damages are real and happening now, as Super typhoon Haiyan so graphically illustrates. We urge all Parties to work with an increased sense of urgency this week and above all focus on doing our part to achieve an ambitious, comprehensive and meaningful outcome. Thank you.\"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. First and foremost, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on this new position as the Co-Chairs of the Durban Platform. We will assure you our full support and unreserved cooperation to make concrete progress in advancing the work of the Durban Platform. Mr. Co-Chairs, we welcome the decision achieved in Doha on advancing the Durban Platform, which reaffirms that the work of the Durban Platform shall be guided by the principles of the Convention. We also welcome the progress made at the two meetings in Bonn this year as well as the acknowledgement by Parties that the Durban Platform process is to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention in order to achieve its ultimate objective. The process and outcome of the Durban Platform shall be under the Convention and guided by its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The Durban Platform process is by no means to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure, or reinterpret the Convention or its principles, provisions and Annexes. We reiterate our belief that the work of the Durban Platform should not take place in a vacuum. Instead, it should be based on and must be built on the work of the Bali Road Map. The Warsaw Conference should be an implementation COP. The effective implementation of the Bali outcomes is paramount for trust building amongst Parties and a solid foundation for the success of the work on the Durban Platform. Mr. Co-Chairs, We would like to emphasize that the Convention itself has provided the structure and design of the 2015 agreement, which defines the differentiation between developed and developing countries. The 2015 agreement shall adhere to the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Articles 4 and 12 as well as the Annexes, which fully reflect the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The 2015 agreement should address all elements referred to in paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17 in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and should, in particular, give equal priority to adaptation and mitigation as well as means of implementation. In this regard, the negotiation on the 2015 agreement should adhere to an \\x1caction-orientated approach\\x1d, focusing on enhanced actions that need to be undertaken for the implementation of the Convention from 2020 in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change in accordance with their historical responsibilities and what is required by science, by undertaking ambitious quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and fulfilling commitments of providing finance and technology support to developing countries. We welcome the Brazilian submission on the Development of a reference methodology on historical responsibilities by the IPCC to guide domestic consultations for the ADP 2015 agreement, as a useful contribution to discussions on an equity-based approach. The enhanced mitigation and adaptation actions of developing countries should be enabled by the provision of adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed countries. We would like to further highlight the importance of effective implementation of Article 4.7 of the Convention, which is crucial for the 2015 agreement. We recognize that the roundtables and workshops have enabled Parties to enhance their understanding about each other\\x19s position. However, it is necessary for Parties to start focusing on enhanced action on all pillars, mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology of the Convention and drawing a clear picture on the organization of the work in the future. Therefore, we call for a more structured and formal mode of work. This balanced, structured, focused and formal mode of work should be established in Warsaw, which is the essential step towards capturing the progress and defining the content of the agreement. It is also important for the Warsaw Conference to encourage and support Parties to engage in domestic consultations and preparations in the context of the Durban Platform negotiations. We would like to further call on developed countries to do their homework particularly on their provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries in addition to their mitigation commitments. Mr. Co-Chairs, The pre-2020 ambition gaps exist not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building as well as in equitable access to sustainable development. The low level of ambition of developed countries?? commitments on emission reduction and provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support remains a matter of grave concern. If the developed countries had committed to an emission reduction of 40% below their 1990 levels by 2020, the pre-2020 mitigation gap would not even have existed. We stress that the pre-2020 ambition must be addressed in a comprehensive manner primarily through the imp\"'],\n",

Mr. Co-Chair, at the outset, let me welcome you both in this new role and we are confident that under your able leadership we will be able to maintain the high bar you have set and produce an excellent result on the way to the new agreement. Mr. Co-Chair, the agreement to be reached by 2015 should be applicable to all Parties and be based on all the .principles of the Convention, including common but differentiated responsibilities, historical responsibility and equity. It should take into account the latest scientific information be adequately informed by the work of other bodies under the Convention and include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by a broad variety of financing sources, with a leading role by developed country Parties. Mr. Co-chair, on the pre-2020 ambition track we again call for developed country Parties to assume leadership by increasing and enhancing their greenhouse gas reduction commitments, as required by the Convention and consistent with the long term goal agreed since in Copenhagen. To demonstrate commitment, developing country Parties, in particular rainforest nations, are prepared to contribute significantly to the fight against climate change. Mr. Co-chair, REDD+ has the potential to significantly contribute to the global mitigation solution. To make this happen, new and additional financial and technical support for the implementation of REDD+ activities should be provided by developed country Parties, accompanied by a new governance architecture, so that REDD+ countries can assume a primary role in enhancement of the level of ambition. Mr. Co-chair, we appreciate the value of the open and frank exchange of views among Parties under the round-table format so far. At the same we must start to engage in direct negotiations as soon as possible so that a clear and ambitious roadmap up to the end of 2015 is defined here in Warsaw along the following lines. A focused work on the structure and specific aspects of the 2015 agreement should start here and continue up to the next session in March 2014. These considerations should be captured in a non-paper by the co-chairs, as usual practice, to be discussed in the June session in Bonn. Then, Parties should be given time to digest and reflect on the identified key elements of the 2015 agreement so that a negotiating text is made available before COP20. In Lima Parties should then agree on the timeline and milestones for finalization of the agreement by the end of 2015. Finally Mr. Co-Chair, let me assure you that our Coalition is ready and keen to continue working and engaging with all Parties in this process so that a new and ambitious, global climate change regime is established by 2015.

First of all, the EIG congratulates you and your Co-Chair for your election. The EIG is very much looking forward to working with you. Mr Co-Chair. The ADP here in Warsaw must take a significant step towards the 2015 Agreement. Warsaw must provide a clear signal of all Parties to participate under the 2015 Agreement through appropriate mitigation commitments, which may include targets or actions. These commitments of all Parties must be based on the same legal form and on the same internationally agreed rules. It is such a rules-based system common to all Parties that will allow for comparability of efforts - with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities taken into account- that will provide the certainty to the Parties to act in a collective effort and, thus, that will allow for trust and ambition to prosper. We need a rules-based yet dynamic and flexible regime with the participation of all Parties reflecting the changing economic realities, national circumstances, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. With the same priority, we must address adaptation under the 2015 Agreement in a differentiated manner as required. The 2015 Agreement shall promote cooperation in adaptation in view to increase adaptive capacity and resilience of all Parties in the context of sustainable development. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement must be underpinned by adequate means of implementation, an effective financial mechanism and contributions from all developed Parties and those in a position to do so, according to their responsibilities, capacities and equity. Here in Warsaw we must provide a clear signal that all Parties are preparing for their efforts in mitigation, adaptation and mobilization of means of implementation post-2020. It is necessary for this workstream of the ADP work in a more focused way during 2014 that will allow for the drafting of text of the new instrument, as decided at COP 18. Therefore, the EIG advocates the adoption of a Decision, at this COP with the elements, structure and scope of the new agreement. Mr Co-Chair. Pre-2020 Mitigation Ambition is another urgent workstream under the ADP. The current global mitigation ambition falls short from the recommendations by science to hold global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius - we have to strengthen international cooperation on immediate additional actions. Here in Warsaw we must set up focused and technical work under the ADP workstream 2 examining concrete options to increase ambition. And we must provide for a platform to foster initiatives additional to the current mitigation commitments. Finally, the UNFCCC must send a clear invitation to the Montreal Protocol for phasing down the highly climate relevant HFCs. Mr Co-Chair, It is crucial that the urgent issue of pre-2020 ambition is considered at the high-level. The EIG is looking forward to working with you towards a successful Ministerial dialogue under the ADP here in Warsaw on the issue of pre-2020 ambition as well as the 2015 Agreement.

Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, The EU would like to welcome the new co-Chairs. They have our full trust and we are confident that they will constructively take forward the excellent work of their predecessors. The ADP achieved good progress in its sessions in Bonn this year. However, there is still much left to do, little time in which to do it and the imperatives for action could not be stronger. The recent IPCC Working Group 1 report gives us three clear messages: i) climate change is happening; ii) humans are the cause of climate change; iii) and we need to act urgently and effectively if we are to avoid its worst effects. In our discussions in Workstream 1 it is essential that we get deeper into the substance of the elements that Parties want to see included in the 2015 Agreement. These are: adaptation, means of implementation, transparency of action and support as well as mitigation. All these aspects need to be reflected in a fair and ambitious legally binding 2015 agreement. The agreement must be applicable to all Parties, to be adopted at COP21 as agreed and preferably take the form of a Protocol under the Convention. That Agreement must be ambitious enough to keep us on track for below 2?C, catalyse adaptation action and lead us towards a climate resilient world. Parties have made submissions that provide us with useful input towards meeting those objectives that we will need to consider carefully in the coming days. As well as making progress on the substantive elements of the 2015 Agreement, Warsaw must also set out the timeline and process to deliver the Agreement in Paris. The EU and other Parties have proposed ideas for a process to deliver ambitious mitigation commitments in the 2015 Agreement. In particular there has been significant interest in a so-called hybrid approach that combines nationally proposed mitigation commitments with an international process to ensure those commitments are fair and ambitious, and enough to keep us on track for below 2?C. Warsaw needs to consider carefully the ideas presented by Parties. We also need to reach agreement here on the way forward including a timeline to prepare the proposed commitments in 2014. But it is clear that Parties need to also consider a process for how the other essential elements of the 2015 Agreement will be elaborated during 2014. In particular on adaptation, means of implementation and the set of rules, including an accounting framework. All Parties have agreed to close the mitigation ambition gap before 2020. That was an essential element of the agreement reached in Durban. As such the work of Workstream 2 must result in an outcome here which takes forward specific options that consequently lead to tangible results. More particularly, in Warsaw me must agree on a process for considering new and enhanced pre-2020 mitigation pledges and accelerate the full implementation of existing pledges. A pledge is just that - a pledge. There must be no backtracking. In addition we must also identify areas of high mitigation potential in which concrete actions can be taken through voluntary international initiatives, and elaborate the role of the UNFCCC in facilitating, scaling up and supporting such initiativ\"'],\n",

The Umbrella Group has been consistent and clear about what the ADP must deliver a 2015 agreement that is meaningfully applicable to all Parties - establishing a common playing field for all countries to commit to post-2020 action - and an examination of practical options to raise global pre-2020 ambition. To reach our goal we need to move away from the paradigms of the past, and look at how we can create conditions which drive cooperation, confidence and action, all with an appreciation of countries national circumstances, aspirations and capabilities. Science tells us that it is urgent, and we need to enhance the global effort. Co-Chairs, We are encouraged by the constructive discussions this year on the substance of the agreement. They have been helped by the trust Parties have shown in the ability of the previous co-chairs to fairly and productively guide our discussions. We are sure Parties will invest the same confidence in the leadership of our current co-chairs. Much productive work has been carried out in the ADP this year. Through roundtables and workshops in workstream 1, Parties have begun to build an understanding of key elements of the 2015 agreement, including the importance to countries of nationally determined commitments. The need for clear ex-ante and ex-post transparency framework. The need to consider how the 2015 agreement will best secure ambition, including through an up-front consultative process. And the need for a 2015 package that strikes a balance between identifying mitigation as our first line of defence, recognising the reality of the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change now, and means of implementation to support effective mitigation and adaptation outcomes. We need to take this work forward by using Warsaw to build momentum toward an effective 2015 agreement in Paris in which all countries contribute to the best of their abilities. We should continue mapping out the functional elements that will be part of a 2015 instrument and broader package. We will need to lay the groundwork for these elements to be brought together into a single, concise, clear negotiating text for next year. At the same time, all countries should at home begin to consider the contribution they will make to global post-2020 action. We need to think further about how proposed commitments can be clearly defined through accompanying up-front information, allowing everyone to understand what countries propose to do. And we should consider how best to progress work on a transparency framework that supports commitments and gives Parties confidence in each others actions. In workstream 2, we have engaged constructively in conversations on initiatives to help enhance pre-2020 mitigation ambition, and heard many examples of action that is taking place. This includes cooperative actions outside of the UNFCCC to cut emissions - with the Umbrella Group supporting the Montreal Protocol to address the issue of envisaged phase down of HFCs. And every effort counts. To this end, we encourage countries that have not yet made a 2020 pledge including 20 of the top 50 emitters to do so. Co-Chairs, Alongside technical work in the ADP, we need to provide space for conversations to move forward on political aspects of our work. The planned High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on the Durban Platform is a valuable opportunity for these conversations to take place and help build the political will for a 2015 deal and enhanced action pre-2020. The UN Secretary General s summit next September will be a key moment in the political timeline to Paris. We welcome you and entrust you to carry forward the work of the ADP. We look forward to a productive session here in Warsaw under your able stewardship. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['46,2,3,3,20131112,g77china,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, As we begin more focused work the ADP we are faced with the grim impacts of climate change on the ground. During the last three days, Super Typhoon Haiyan, cut a swath of devastation across North Palau and the Central Philippines, leaving a trail of death and widespread destruction. This is the 6th typhoon to hit Palau in the last two years, compared with just two in the preceding 30 years. Both the Philippines and Palau are now struggling desperately to recover from this super typhoon and Vietnam is even now bracing for this storm to make landfall. These horrific events and the tragic loss of lives and property demand that we approach the negotiations on the 2015 agreement with heightened responsibility and renewed urgency. Mr. Co-Chairs, As we have stated previously The Group of 77 and China strongly believe that the decisions of Durban and Doha provide the mandate for the work of the ADP. In work-stream one including inter alia on Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology Development and Transfer, Transparency of Actions and Support, and Capacity Building. On work-stream two, on a work plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to identify and to explore options for a range of actions that can close the ambition gap with a view to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts by all Parties. We also underline the high priority that the Group attaches to enhancing actions on adaptation and means of implementation in the work of the ADP. The Group of 77 and China also reiterate that the effective implementation of the Bali Road Map will lay a solid foundation for the success of the work of the Durban Platform. The Group is prepared to engage with you and with our Annex I partners to progress our work in a more balanced, focused, formal and Party-driven mode here in Warsaw, focusing on the enhanced actions under the elements of Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology Development and Transfer, Transparency of Actions and Support, and Capacity Building and reiterates the need to maintain a balance, both in terms of content and progress of the work in both workstreams, and stresses that all elements of post-2020 outcome should have the same legal nature. To this end, the Group of 77 and China believes that the six points identified as the Group s position on ADP at the April session remain relevant and bear repeating; i. The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles, and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; ii. The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; iv. The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. In the work of the ADP under work-stream 2, as we have also stated previously, developed countries must demonstrate clear and unconditional leadership in mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology development and transfer. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China expects that the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol enter into force as soon as possible. It is paramount that the ambition mechanism launched in Doha effectively results in the increase of the ambition of Annex I Parties quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments for the second commitment period. We therefore urge all Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to go through the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible, and to revisit and significantly increase their quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments by 2014. It is crucial that we should ensure the operationalization and implementation of the 2014 Revisit Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol in Warsaw. We likewise urge non-KP Annex I Parties to increase their mitigation ambition in a comparable manner within the same timeframe. All Annex I Parties must undertake additional verifiable actions under the Kyoto Protocol, as well as under the Convention with a view to close the ambition gap by 2020. The enhanced commitments from the Annex I Parties in 2014 for the post-2020 period should be the first step, since this would directly impact the level of ambition in workstream 1 for the post-2020 period. The members of Group of 77 and China have made greater contributions on combating climate change than those of developed countries during the pre-2020 period. We urge developed country Parties to fulfill and enhance their commitments on the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries, which is fundamental for developing countries to implement our actions on adaptation and mitigation. Mr. Co-Chairs, As we have repeatedly been reminded by the Presidency of the COP, time is not on our side. We fully concur. Even as I speak, 600,000 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas of Vietnam in response to the same typhoon, further underscoring the importance of financing and implementing adaptation measures. Ultimately, the Group is of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, and should further strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention in order to achieve its ultimate objective. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",

While we think that there are far too many issues that were left undecided by our work here in Warsaw on ADP, we are heartened by the progress on Workstream 2. We believe that paragraph 5 of this decision provides a real opportunity to unlock mitigation opportunities that will help get us back on track to limit warming to well below 1.5 degrees. It is crucial that we go home, do our homework, and bring options for enhanced mitigation efforts for decisive action by Ministers at key political moments in this coming year.\"'],\n",
              "       ['48,2,3,3,20131112,lmdc,\"LMDC Opening Statement for ADP - COP 19. Mr. Co-Chairs. I make this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. We fully endorse the statement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. I take the liberty of making some specific points on various aspects of the 2015 Outcome so that we will be able to engage constructively with the other Parties to take the discussions in the ADP forward. The 2015 Outcome for the post-2020 period should be guided by the Principles and Provisions of the Convention, on the basis of Equity and in accordance withCommon but Differentiated Responsibilities, since it is under the Convention. We recall Article 3.1 of the Convention where, inter alia, it is also incumbent that developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects. It is important that we build on the principles and provisions of the Convention by preserving and reinforcing various aspects of the Convention, where enhanced actions are required to meet the ultimate objective of the Convention. In addition, we see the need to make progress on enhanced action on all the elements identified in para 5 of decision 1. CP 17 of the Durban COP. We see progress in enhancing the implementation of the elements as a balanced and comprehensive one. By this, we mean that the progress should be on all the elements a.nd the progress should be symmetrical. We would like to underline that whatever legal form we adopt, all elements of the post-2020 outcome should have the same legal nature. We cannot have a situation where different elements in the so-called package are treated differently under any agreement. We also believe that the Annexes in the Convention are based on scientific assessments of historical responsibilities. To abolish the Annexes or to make them irrelevant would be to obfuscate the historical responsibilities of developed countries. This is clearly against the provisions of the Convention. Mitigation by developed countries must be central to the post-2020 period and the developed countries should, according to Article 3.1, take the lead through ambitious emission reductions undertaken domestically. There must be comparability of efforts among Annex I Parties with respect to their mitigation 1 commitments. Mitigation contributions should be determined nationally for Non-Annex I Parties. It is inevitable that there would be a variety in the nature of actions or contributions e.g. enhanced NAMAs) by Non-Annex I Parties. Consequently, actions of Non-Annex I Parties should be nationally determined. We have put in place ICA and IAR to review the QELROs of Annex I and the NAMAs of non-Annex I made for the post-2020 period. Much work has been done on the transparency regime and we need to use it to bring greater clarity to the process. Furthermore, in addition to differentiation) there must appropriate sequencing?tnterrns of mitigation under the Convention. Developed countries take the lead on mitigation as well as other areas) under the Convention. Developing countries may follow with enhanced actions to implement the Convention on the basis of support from developed countries according to Article 4.7. We do not see any role for a two-step process in the ex-ante process for review of efforts of developing countries. Any framework which seeks to determine for developing countries what they should contribute in any future regime goes against the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities based on historical responsibility. As Article 3.1 states, equity lies in developed countries taking the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof. Non-Annex I Parties cannot be on the same template as the Annex I Parties. Any enhancement of ambitions to meet any future mitigation gap, and even the current one, should be done in accordance with article 3.1 and the Annex I Parties should take the lead and meet it. Applicability to all doesn t mean uniformity in application. The ADP outcome as a multilateral instrument would be applicable to all Parties but that there can be differentiation in both its content and its application by Parties on the basis of the differentiation already established by the Convention between developed and developing countries. Articles 12.1 and 12.2 of the Convention deals with reporting obligations. We have had separate tracks on reporting and accounting rules as per the nature of the responsibility we have, as reflected in the two Annexes. It is not conceivable that the nervousness of the responsibility of Non-Annex I should be the same as Annex I. Common Accounting Rules cannot be for all Parties without any regard for the two Annexes and the nature of their reporting obligations. Common Accounting rules are for the Annex I parties, for both KP and non-KP Parties, As regards the timing of putting forward QELROs for Annex I and of contributions for non?Annex I for the post-2020 period, we need to keep in mind the ambition levels of the pre-2020 period and Work Stream 2. What we have agreed in Doha is to review commitments and enhance the 2 ambition of the Annex I parties under KP. We need to know as a first step by how much the ambition levels are bring increased. Consequently, we will call for the 2014 review on commitments being undertaken first by Annex before we move to the post-2020 period. If not, then there is a real danger of ambition level of the pre-2020 period being transferred to the post2020 period.  We recall Article 4.7 in the context of actions on mitigation. This means that the extent to which developing countries implement the Convention and enhance their actions depends on the extent to which developed countries fulfill their obligations under Art. 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. Enhanced action on mitigation will require enhanced action on means of implementation. We also need to respond to economic and social consequences of response measures as set out under the Bali Action Plan. Adaptation is a key priority for us. Art 4.4 defines the basis for international cooperation in this regard, under which Annex II Parties commit to support the costs in developing countries to address the adverse effects of climate change, including on loss and damage. However, adaptation has not rec.eived adequate attention as opposed to mitigation despite the large number of decisions by the COP on adaptation. This situation has to change and we need enhanced action. The Loss and Damage mechanism established in Doha must? be made operational. Adaptation institutions under the Convention must be strengthened and financed. Quantitative increases In the ability of adaptation financing institutions to deliver and support funding for adaptation in developing countries must be made. In this regard, the NAPs of all developing countries must be fully supported. We also need to enhance action on adaptation relating to economic diversification to build resilience as set out in the Bali Action Plan. The fulcrum of the balance In the Convention lies in Art 4.7, under which the extent-to which developing countries Implement their commitments under the Convention depends on the extent to which developed?counttres implement their commitments to provide finance and technology under Art 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. The financing obligation under the Convention is for Annex II Parties, not for their private sector. As such, public finance from developed countries must be the primary source of financing to developing countries under the Convention. Public financing could leverage private finance and other sources but should remain the primary vehicle. Financing requirements does not mean creating an enabling environment. The $100 billion to be provided by developed countries at Cancun is only the starting point for the post-2020 period and not the ending point. This needs to be scaled up to meet the necessary levels of the real financing needs of developing countries in the context of the actions that they need to undertake in order to cope with the adverse effects of global warming up to and beyond the 2C temperature goal. The Convention s financial mechanism must be made more robust, with new, additional, adequate and predictable funding going towards its operating entities such as the GCF. In this regard, Annex II parties must provide a clear roadmap for public climate financing from developed? countries with specific targets, timellnes, and sources. Any burden-sharing for the provision of climate finance, under the Convention, must be done-among developed countries. We also need to reinforce nonmarket approaches and mechanisms. We need as much transparency in the means of implementation as in clarifying mitigation pledges and commitments. We look at financing under the Convention as the commitment of Annex 11 only and not the role of South-South cooperation. South-South cooperation has evolved as a voluntary effort over time and completely differs from the obligatory and responsibility framework which motivates the North-South template. Another important aspect on which enhanced action is required in the context of technology development and transfer are removal of barriers, especially issues related to IPRs, and enhanced financial support for technology development and transfer for developing countries. Article 4.5 of the Convention is far from realising the potential for which it was inserted. Enhanced action should apply to both mitigation and adaptation related technologies. We call on specific windows for technology development and transfer in the Convention financial mechanism entities and funds e.g. GCF, GEF, AF, LDCF, SCCF, etc. Annex I Parties need to put in place the enabling environment in their own countries that will remove the barriers such as cost and IPRs) to technology development and transfer and enable them to effectively implement their technology development and transfer obligations to developing countries. Transparency of the provision of support will be a key element in the ADP outcome. Enhancements are needed with respect to the transparency regime for the provision of support to developing countries, including financing and technology\"'],\n",

Our Group associates itself with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of G77 and China, by Swaziland on behalf of the Africa Group, and by Nauru on behalf of the AOSIS. First of all, I would like to congratulate both of you on your election as Co-chairs of the ADP. We believe that under your able leadership, ADP will deliver concrete outcomes here in Warsaw. I thank you and the Secretariat for the preparations made for this meeting. Thank you also for the two technical papers, the overview of institutions, mechanisms and arrangements under the Convention, as well as your scenario note. As you mentioned in your message, we fully agree with you that the ADP has laid a strong foundation and we are now ready to shift gears, moving on from developing and understanding the concepts to defining the content of the 2015 agreement and achieving concrete results on pre-2020 ambition. Co-Chairs, we have spent a considerable time sharing our views on the scope, structure and elements of the 2015 agreement. It is now time that we start building the process for the 2015 agreement by further clarifying the way forward. The time and the schedule we have for this is very tight. Co-Chairs, we reiterate that the outcomes of the ADP must be in line with the ultimate objective of the Convention and this can only be achieved through a collective and equitable sharing of efforts and universal participation. With the very survival of many of our nations at stake, only the highest level of commitment from all is acceptable. Only this will guarantee global climate action towards stabilization of the average global temperature to prevent dangerous climate change. Some Parties advocate their right to assess whether their contribution under the 2015 agreement is acceptable to them. However, we are concerned that the current proposals do not respect moral and legal obligations of these parties to respect the right of the most vulnerable countries to defend their survival.  We believe that a voluntary, non-binding pledge and review regime will not deliver what is required by science to address the climate change challenge and could lead towards a 4 ?C warming world while the scientific community has shown that the l.5?C goal is still technically and economically feasible. However, the frontiers of possibilities are closing faster. Co-Chairs, in this context, we have four suggestions for the way forward in Warsaw: Advance on concrete actions under both workstreams through formal sessions rather than general workshops and roundtables only. To this end, we suggest that we establish two contact groups- one for each workstream. Work on clear vision of timeline and deliverables needed to reach the global agreement at COP 21 and close the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap as soon as possible. This means that we should advance in all the fronts, including ensuring a decision to set up a clear process to clarify all Parties emissions reduction targets - and financial contributions under both workstreams. The new agreement should address mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity building in a balanced and effective manner.

By the Republic of the Sudan, at the Opening Plenary of Fouth Part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group Of Durban Platform on Enhance Action Bonn, Germany, 10-14 March 2014. Co-chairs, Allow me at the outset to express our appreciations to the Govemment of Germany for hosting meeting, and for the Conventions Secretariat for their excellent The African Group reiterates its views regarding the importance of maintaining the integrity of the ADP process within the UNFCCC framework, which is multilateral in nature, and rules-based. We enter tnis phase of our discussions to negotiate in good faith, and will work under your able guidance, towards outcome that will serve all our interests in a balanced maimer. Effective global cooperation is not an option for Africa, but a necessity as impacts of climate change continue to undermine our pursuit of sustainable development. Global action is urgent in addressing this serious challenge of climate change. Co-chairs, we take note of your scenario note, including proposals that you have put forward in respect of hope we organize our work for this session, as well as substantive elements that we as parties need to deliberate in the course of 2014. It is our view that we need a clear work plan for all sessions in this year for both workstreams. We conmend the work you have done to date as Co-chairs, we affirm our continued support to you in guiding us through this negotiation. Our expectations for 2014, as outlined in decision 1/CP.19, is nothing short of elements of the draft negotiating text for the 2015 Agreement, which would reflect the views expressed and negotiated by Parties. The various modalities which included open-ended consultations, briefings, workshops, and others, have been useful in distilling some important aspects of the elements of the negotiating text that need our attention. We see a role for a variety of modalities as different issues are at different stages of maturity, however recognising the an1ount of time available to us, as well as the centrality of Party ownership of negotiating text, we are of the view that this session would be an opportune time to work in a contact group format, such that Parties views can be formally recorded, and that we can capture emerging convergence on some issues. Co-chairs, On substantive elements of the scenario note, firstly the work on contributions envisaged in the Warsaw decision, our expectations tally with what you identified in the scenario note, we need to build understanding on what the contributions are, how they will be communicated, received and assessed. Our expectation is that by June we should be in a position to inform on our domestic preparatory processes, whilst adopting a decision to that effect in Lima. The second aspect of our substantive world which is elements of the draft negotiating text, our view is that paragraph 5 of decision l/CP .17 provides a sound basis for the definition of elements of the negotiating text, whilst acknowledging the work we have done to date under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol as an integral part of the 2015 Agreement. Our proposal is that we should create space for a discussion on the architecture of the 2015 Agreement, taking note of our proposal for an architecture that covers, general aggregate commitments, specific commitments, definition of the role of operational mechanisms and institutions established under the Convention, and lastly, transparency, accountability, compliance and review provisions, building on Bali Action Plan and KP mechanisms. Co-chairs, the ADP workstream 2 is the ultimate building block to demonstrate our resolve in tackling climate change in any significant manner under the 2015 Agreement. In Warsaw, we reaffirmed the importance of accelerating implementation of all Bali Actions Plan decisions, as well as increasing ambition both under the Convention and the pre-2020 ambition workplan. We also took note of the UN Secretary General Summit next September, and the Ministerial Dialogue next June and at COP 20, and it is important for us to understand how these processes will inform the negotiation process, as well as the work needed under the UNFCCC to support those processes. In this session, Co-chairs, you have organized the world around the renewable energy and energy efficiency sub-sectors. As much as we stand ready to engage during the following days specifically on these areas we stress the necessity of addressing two elements to further enhance our work. We have indicated our expectation of a clear organisation of work for the year, and we would like early engagement of our Group on topics for each session in order to ensure effective participation and ownership of the process. Co-chairs, if we are to achieve a significant and adequate increase in the level of global mitigation ambition in the near future, we have to go beyond identifying and exploring mitigation potentials in different economic sectors by elaborating a comprehensive and robust incentive framework allowing both developed and developing countries to harness those potentials. Therefore, Africa would request the preparation of a technical paper identifying the full range of incentives- types per thematic and geographical distribution, which would help in making concrete recommendations to the COP for its consideration. Co-chairs, The African Group stand ready during this session to enter into an open and transparent dialogue in a formal mode of work: that would move us toward achieving the mandate of ADP for this year, and bring us closer to an agreed elements of negotiation text for the 2015 agreement.

              "       ['51,2,4,4,20140310,ailac,\"GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS: AILAC reiterates that in its view, the negotiations under the ADP should have as an outcome the definition of a new agreement that will be legally binding in nature. This legally binding agreement should aim at achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention, and be based on science. In this light, AILAC stresses that all the components of the legally binding agreement should be granted equal relevance and should have the same legal nature.  The link between climate change and development options should be clearly reflected on the legally binding agreement. Climate change is a direct threat to development. This threat is represented in the impacts that climate change has in all countries, and especially in those developing countries that are particularly vulnerable, which directly undermine the efforts to achieve sustainable development by inflicting incalculable losses in their economic, social and environmental structures and development trajectories, and undermining efforts to guarantee the wellRbeing of their populations. Thus, climate change is a threat to the equitable right to development, not because the need to limit emissions, but because its impacts limit development opportunities and undermines development gains. Poverty eradication efforts are therefore challenged.   In this context, the focus of the new legally binding agreement should be on options and actions that all countries can pursue in order to pursue sustainable development pathways compatible with climate protection. The \\x1cclimateRfriendly economy\\x1d is about addressing development needs while mitigating GHG emissions so as to avoid catastrophic climate change. The new legally binding agreement should set the conditions for a global economy of growth that is climate-sensitive: a \\x1cClimate Global Economy\\x1d. Achieving this outcome requires an inclusive, transparent, and partyRdriven process. Arriving at the required deep and structural transformation of world economy to a lowRcarbon, climate-resilient development paradigm requires that the UNFCCC process deliver ambitious evidenceR based results, with engaged participation by all Parties in the definition of the future agreement. However, Parties need to ensure that the final agreement has the necessary flexibility to take into account each country\\x19s specific and evolving circumstances, and thus avoiding the need for renegotiations in the future.  2014 is the pivotal year for the process, and Lima the key milestone. What we achieve R or not R in Lima will be decisive in defining the level of ambition, scope and nature of the new agreement. Therefore, there is an urgent need to make substantial progress during 2014 in the process of achieving a legally binding agreement by COP21 in Paris. A prerequisite for this is to arrive at functional draft text by COP20 in Lima.   During COP19, we failed both to agree to a clear timeline that would guide the work we are now starting in this session, and to define the specific elements that will be included in the agreement. It is fundamental that in the first session of 2014 we agree to the timeline, and that we define the specific elements of the agreement no later than the June session SBs 40, ADP 2R5). We trust, however, that Parties will understand the historic responsibility that we have and ensure that we do not get caught in fruitless, tactical discussions over \\x1cprocess\\x1d. STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE AGREEMENT: The COP mandated the ADP to further elaborate, beginning at this first session of the ADP in 2014, the elements for a draft negotiating text including the work on, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacityRbuilding and transparency of action and support. AILAC reiterates what was expressed in the previous submission put forward in August 2013, regarding the overall structure of the new legally binding agreement, which shall include at least the following elements: Preamble; Mitigation including REDD+; Adaptation and Loss and Damage; Means of Implementation; Transparency; Compliance. The next paragraphs develop some initial ideas on the content for each of these elements, without prejudice to the need to include additional elements and additional detail in the content of each element, as the boundaries of the new legally binding agreement are defined.  First, Preamble. The preamble needs to make a reference at least to the following basic aspects:  R The ultimate objective of the convention and the global goal to achieve it through the implementation of the new legally binding agreement; R The fundamental basis of the agreement on science; R The core characteristic of the agreement that refers to it being \\x1capplicable to all\\x1d; R The principles of the Convention as a basis and guiding framework for the new agreement, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, including historic responsibility and evolving respective capabilities; The recognition of the collective responsibility incumbent on all parties for both mitigation and adaptation, based on equity and sustainable development; Second, Mitigation including REDD+. The agreement must have a section on mitigation, which would address at least the following issues: A reference to the global mitigation goal that needs to be achieved through efforts by all parties according to the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. A reference to the mechanism to determine nationally determined contributions, which should take a legally binding form, to ensure the new agreement is actually applicable to all and will enhance ambition at the national level in every country party, and through this, at the global level with the aim of achieving the common goal; A reference to the basic information that needs to accompany the statement of commitment made by each country party, in order to make commitments comparable, and to ensure that their format allows for global aggregation in order to ensure environmental integrity in the achievement of the common goal; . In general, the contributions should be: Predictable, Comparable, Understandable. Provide information on assumptions that underpin the commitments: baseline year, timeframe, sectors and gases covered, emissions factors, methodology applied, use of markets, treatment of reduction units. A process for anchoring nationally defined contributions in the agreement;  Provisions related to accounting and transparency of action; Provisions related to the support, including finance, technology transfer, and capacity building specifically for mitigation actions; and Provisions related to market and nonmarket mechanisms and their role in the national and global mitigation efforts, including on co-benefits of mitigation actions that go beyond GHG reductions. A review mechanism of contributions should be included and allow for ambition to be updated on the basis of science in the light of any possible future gap to achieve the global goal of keeping the increase of global temperature below 2?C or 1.5?C. The provisions on mitigation must take into account that universality of application \\x1capplicable to all\\x1d does not mean uniformity. In AILAC\\x19s understanding the way to ensure equity is the implementation of a fair differentiation, where capacity and political will towards the highest level of ambition possible are at the core.  In this light, contributions should be nationally determined, based on the each country\\x19s national context, capabilities, responsibility and challenges. Support should be given to countries who need it most and who are willing to go beyond their capacity. Thus, differentiation must be between types of contributions. The agreement must put in place the right incentives so that all parties in a position to do so take action and become more ambitious. AILAC reiterates that leadership on mitigation should come from developed country parties, in light of their historic responsibility and their capacity. Without prejudice of this leadership that all developed countries should take, AILAC countries are also leading in the measure of their own capabilities, and often beyond their responsibility for climate change. We wish to highlight the need for all parties to be ambitious in contributing to global efforts to combat climate change according to their own capacities, under the leadership of developed country parties. REDD+: We believe that the contribution of REDD+ to global climate change mitigation efforts is substantial and can be enhanced. REDD+ is a fundamental part of national climate change strategies and should be considered in the future post 2020 instruments in its proper dimension.  Considering that REDD+ has been designed on the basis of a voluntary and cooperative initiative between developed and developing countries and that the REDD mechanism architecture was defined by the Warsaw REDD+ framework, there is a window of opportunity to include this mechanism, both at pre and post 2020 timeframes, in Work stream 1 and 2 of ADP. To achieve this goal, we believe that there is an urgent need to reach an agreement that provides sufficient, appropriate, transparent and predictable funding in the preR2020 timeframe to meet the expectations that have been generated. The need for REDD+ to be in place before 2020 is also relevant to foster synergies with other Conventions and help countries meet their Aichi 2020 targets for the Convention of Biological Diversity. In the post-2020 timeframe, we believe this mechanism should be considered as a priority, with the appropriate modifications in a post 2020 world, so it can continue to contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change. We hope that the spirit of constructiveness demonstrated during the REDD+ design process, continues to reflect the importance that forests have in global climate change mitigation efforts, while at the same time ensuring robust methodological frameworks to enhance environmental integrity. Adaptation and Loss and Damage Adaptation is a matter of collective responsibility on addressing climate change, ensuring sustainable development and eradication poverty, and should be treated as such under the Convention and in the new agreement. Climate change impacts, and thus adaptation opportunities are central to development efforts in developing countries in several sectors such as health, culture, water, food security, biodiversity and ecosystem services, affecting the most vulnerable and causing migrations and climate refugees. Contrary to what is commonly stated, adaptation is not only a local issue. Impacts and costs can be and should be assessed at local levels, but they can also be aggregated at national, regional, and global levels. Substantive, timely, and efficient investments in adaptation, as well as mitigation effort, are required to keep us within the adaptation context, when still possible, and not in a loss and damage setting. Loss and damage is however a reality for many countries and communities and thus should be addressed by the Convention and the new agreement. Both adaptation and loss & damage should be included as elements in the agreement to be agreed in Paris. There is an opportunity to further strengthen work on adaptation in the UNFCCC context, for instance an adaptation assessment framework must be established under the Convention. Also, and without prejudice of all institutional arrangements in place to support the LDCs, it is key that the focus on adaptation becomes broader, and includes all parties and not just developing countries. Within developing countries however, it is also important that more permanent and solid structures that support adaptation processes of nonRLDC parties are established, without undermining the existing ones in place for LDCs. We need to ensure coherence within the adaptation instruments and modalities approved to date under different platforms under the Convention, and the new post 2020 instrument should contribute to better structuring adaptation elements, a key priority for highly vulnerable countries like ours. Another opportunity for strengthening adaptation is further advancing on the metrics. We need to agree on methodologies to make adaptation assessments. Although this discussion is already ongoing under loss & damage, it should be brought also into the adaptation discussions. Only by measuring it is possible to understand the global implications of adaptation. Methodologies and indicators are fundamental for adaptation processes and the Convention should support parties in identifying costs, impacts, vulnerability, and baselines to measure progress. There should also be support for parties for sectoral and territorial adaptations options. Means of implementation are fundamental for developing country parties to be able to assess adaptation needs, and formulate and implement NAPS. Adaptation has been heavily underfunded and public funds are needed to support and catalyze action, as well as enhanced financial, technical and scientific support. Involvement of the private sector is also decisive for adaptation efforts in all countries, but concrete options and opportunities are not well understood and the Secretariat should assist countries in advancing on this front, beyond involvement of the insurance sector. The African Group\\x19s proposal con the adaptation goal is interesting and AILAC is looking forwards to have more in depth discussions on the proposal and how it might be included in the new agreement. The National Adaptation Plans NAPs) provide the essential basis for all countries to undertake necessary steps to identify and assess vulnerabilities and exposures within and across sectors, identify options, and define both soft and hard adaptation responses. For this purpose, there is a need for enhanced financial, technical and scientific support for countries to undertake these assessments, and formulate and implement NAPs. Clear support mechanisms for parties undertaking formulation or implementation of National Development Plans should be established. The Nairobi Work Programme should be strengthened and elements included under the Programme should be built upon in the new agreement and mainstreamed into the broader adaptation discussions. Loss & damage: The new agreement must build upon the Warsaw International Mechanism of Loss and Damage and its Work plan to ensure that the issue is given a central place under the new agreement. Efforts should be directed towards ensuring that the Executive Committee of the Mechanism is fully substantive and not bureaucratic, and focuses on developing countries\\x19 vulnerability and the identification of specific country needs. Also, given the mandate provides for progress on coordination among existing Convention bodies and coherence between different approaches to address loss and damage, special attention should be given to enhance the technical capacities of financial institutions in developing countries so as to identify the gaps and needs in the actions that will be undertaken. Means of Implementation: The new agreement will include a section on means of implementation that should include at least the following elements: An overarching guiding objective that should be the foundation of all the provision of means of implementation, addressing the need to transition to a world where all investments are climate friendly investments, and where climate finance, technology and capacity stop competing against carbonRintensive actions; Provisions on the national responsibility of all countries to mobilize and invest resources in climate friendly actions at the national level, and to mainstream climate change in national spending; An explicit reference to historical responsibility of developed countries and its relationship with the provision of climate finance to developing countries for contributing to their mitigation and adaptation efforts; A request to strengthen the existing provision of climate finance and enhance it significantly, to achieve the maximum level of ambition possible in the provision of means of implementation; Specific reference to the definition of nationally determined contributions on the provision of means of implementation that shall ensure that adaptation and mitigation action actually happen on the ground; these should be part of the overall process of defining the national contributions, and be subject to the same process of \\x1canchoring\\x1d in the legally binding agreement; A reference to the areas there the mean of implementation should be directed to be transformative in the results of the action implemented through them; Operational provisions related to the financial architecture of the Convention, the relationship of the compliance mechanism with the contributions of means of implementation, the MRV of support, among other operational issues. The contributions on the provision of means of implementation need also to be defined as soon as possible; their definition should be in line with what will be agreed on the process for the definition of the nationally determined contributions in general. The new legally binding agreement must ensure predictability in the medium and long term for the provision of the means of implementation, on the one hand, and on the other, provide all that is required for a transformation at scale in the way in which both public and private investments are made. Predictability and scale in the means of implementation are a fundamental requirement for this transition. The agreement must address the issue of means of implementation in a holistic manner, including the provision of finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. All of these elements are necessary to implement action on the ground and can be part of the nationally defined contributions \"'],\n",
              "       ['52,2,4,4,20140310,alba,\"This statement is in name of the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). We partner with statements made for Bolivia on behalf of G77 + China and by the Philippines on behalf of the LMDC group. As ALBA countries we consider it important to highlight some points keys, which should guide the work of the Parties, in these negotiations under the Durban Platform. First of all, we want to emphasize the need for this process is fully developed under the principles and provisions of the Convention, in accordance with all the elements of the Decision is 1 / CP.17, 2 / CP.18 and 1 / CP.19. For this to be effective, it is crucial to guide the work based on the application of the Principle of Common But D ifferentiated Responsibilities, with developed countries taking the lead in reducing emissions and in fulfilling the commitments assumed under the Convention due to the debt and historical responsibility that the developed countries have before humanity. That leadership should be expressed in the form of commitments quantified, concrete and ambitious, which must be announced as soon as possible, to give impetus to this process. We warn that up to now these commitments are not being fulfilled, which set an inappropriate precedent for this negotiation. Co Presidents, ALBA\\'s expectations about work future of this Durban Platform group are intrinsically determined by this aspect, and linked to the result of the June ministerial meeting this year on the outcome of the June ministerial meeting this year on the ambition levels of the Ambition Partielevels of Parties to Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol It is necessary to emphasize that any action of the countries in development, according to the Convention, is subject to the provision of means of implementation (transfer of financing, technology and skills development), from the countries developed to developing countries, for which define a roadmap for effective financing and technological support for mitigation and adaptation actions that developing countries should voluntarily carry out. Is It is important to remember that Decision 1CP19 warns that the preparation of the \"\"nationally determined actions\"\", to which referred to in paragraph 2.b), are subject to financial support by developed countries, as noted in paragraph 2 d) of the own decision. For the ALBA Group, the \\x1cnational contributions certain \\x1ddefined in Decision 1CP / 19, refer to all elements of the new agreement and are therefore not limited to the mitigation. In addition, contributions in adaptation, loss and damage, financing, transfer of financing and technology, and capacity development. In In particular, developed countries must report on their financial contributions, consistent with the commitments that are already under the Convention today, and that until the moment have not been presented satisfactorily. Likewise, the ALBA group considers that the response \\x1dto climate change must be effectively considered and incorporated in the new agreement, understanding the integrated vision to interrelate the confrontation with climate change, with our right to comprehensive and sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and its extreme consequences. It is essential to ensure that the process is real and effective led by the Parties. Any document that is produced must conform only to the positions presented by the Parties. To advance in that direction, we need to adopt, since this Meeting a more structured way of working, a formal, transparent and inclusive process that produces authentic negotiation, under the absolute mandate of the Parties. Therefore, it requires a contact group for workstream 1. The legal nature of that Agreement should not be prejudged; We must apply the principle that form follows content. The substantive result of the negotiation will define the form of the agreement. These substantive results should cover, in a balanced way, the set of elements, agreed in Durban, that is: the adaptation, mitigation, finance, \"'],\n",

Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me congratulate you on the important leadership you have demonstrated already this year and assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work together to achieve our common objectives. Thank you for your thoughtful scenario note, we agree with the priorities and mode of work it proposes for this session, while recognizing that our discussions should become increasingly focused as we move forward. We also fully recognize that this is a party-driven process and that we must soon move to direct consultations and negotiations between Parties. Co-Chairs, 2014 is a special year for our members. Just two weeks ago, at United Nations Headquarters in New York, we joined our colleagues in launching the International Year of Small Island Developing States-the first time a group of countries has been so recognized. The yearlong recognition is meant to call attention to the many contributions the people of Island Nations have made to our collective heritage as global citizens as well to raise awareness for the specific sustainable challenges facing SIDS, including the impacts of climate change. It also comes at a crossroads for our worl< here. If we fail to take bold action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, the opportunity to avert the worst impacts of the crisis may be irrevocably lost. We welcome the opening of the technical expert meetings under Workstream 2 of the ADP and are eager to translate the lessons we learn into concrete progress and real mitigation action on the ground. We think the focus here on renewable energy and energy efficiency provides an opportunity to focus on an area of high mitigation potential and to highlight areas where intensive cooperation among governments, international organizations and financial institutions, the private sector and civil society can produce new mitigation ambition, including through matching bright ideas with international support. It is also important to be mindful that these efforts have significant co-benefits for sustainable development and adaptation. We look forward to this work? informing the ministerial discussions on ambition in June and help expedite actions to be launched at the UN Secretary-General\\'s Summit in September. We will also continue to encourage Parties to raise the ambition of their 2020 pledges, or to come forward with new pledges for those who have not yet done so, and we think Workstream 2 will help give us all confidence that we can in fact do what is necessary. Co-Chairs, In terms of the 2015 agreement (under Workstream 1), we must also make clear progress and continue to build on the foundation of the Convention, including all of its principles and provisions. The fact that we are now negotiating a new protocol applicable to all does not relieve developed countries of their responsibility to tak:e the lead in addressing climate change. We cannot afford any backsliding in the type, nature, or ambition of their mitigation commitments under the 2015 agreement. The outcome of the Paris conference in 2015 should be a legally binding Protocol under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties, which will require universal participation and contributions from all parties. The safety, viability and survival of our members demands that the agreement be based on science and include a global goal of limiting global warming to well below 1.5 degrees. Therefore, we reiterate that the outcome of the 2013-2015 Review is central to the Workstream 1 process to ensure that we are meeting our imperatives. In this context, the level of ambition of the 2015 agreement is critical to the survival of SIDS. We are therefore proposing that this session focus on the following, inter alia: First, We should begin the identification of the elements that would be included in the final 2015 agreement. Second, We encourage focus on identifying the information needed to allow parties to present their information in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency, and understanding of nationally determined contributions. Third, This will inform a process that would lead to an urgent submission of parties\\' proposed national contributions in a transparent and verifiable manner that enables quantification and assessment against the long-term global goal of holding warming below 1.SC; and move toward a process to review proposed n\"\"tional contributions. Furthermore it must articulate: A balanced treatment of mitigation and adaptation, including a clearly defined relationship between mitigation ambition and adaptation costs as well as loss and damage, particularly when adaptation measures are not sufficient to address climate impacts; and A provision for long-term, scaled up, predictable, new and additional finance, technology and capacity building to cover the costs of adaptation and loss and damage. Unfortunately, we know that severe climate impacts are already occurring and that much worse still lies ahead. Only last week the Marshall Islands and Kiribati were severely da\"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. At the outset, we would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of the Co-Chairs in facilitating the ADP negotiation process in Warsaw last year and assure you of our continued support and cooperation in the ADP negotiations this year. Mr. Co-Chairs, We welcome the progress on the Durban Platform made in Warsaw. We are however concerned with the effective implementation of the Bali outcomes in Warsaw as well as the period from now to 2020. The effective implementation of the Bali, Cancun, Durban and Doha outcomes will be paramount for trust building amongst Parties in order to create the necessary conditions and an international enabling environment for a successful conclusion of the work on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. Mr. Co-Chairs The ADP Warsaw Decision further reiterates that the Durban Platform is under the Convention and shall be guided by the principles of the Convention, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibiltties. This has been emphasized in Durban and Doha decisions. It is important to once again remind ourselves that the Durban Platform is to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. This means that the 2015 agreement must strengthen the multilateral, rule-based system under the Convention It is by no means to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure, or reinterpret the Convention or its principles, provisions and Annexes. It shall be based on science and the principles of equity and CBDR, as well as the promotion of sustainable development. In order for the Durban Platform process to raise the level of ambition, the 2015 agreement must adhere to the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Articles 4 and 12 as per the Annexes, which fully reflect the common but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries. In decision1CP/19, in Warsaw, we decided to elaborate, beginning at the first session of ADP in 2014, the elements for a draft negotiating text. We stress that the 2015 agreement should address all elements referred to in paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17, i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support, in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and should not just be confined to mitigation. Mr. Co-Chairs, The Warsaw ADP decision also invited all Parties to initiate and intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions and to identify the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions. However, with regard to the intended nationally determined contributions, it is important to understand that contributions should cover all the pillars of the Convention, i.e. mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance and technology to developing countries, and be in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular the Article 4 of the Convention. We call on developed countries to make their preparations and include in their submissions information particular on the provision of 2 finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries in addition to their mitigation commitments. Developing country Parties\\' contributions will be in the context of sustainable development, and dependent on the financial and technological support provided by developed country Parties. We also believe that information to facilitate the understanding and transparency of the contributions shall be differentiated between developed and developing countries. The Durban Platform has already traversed half of its destination in terms of allotted time but the final destination in terms of substance is still a distant reality. With only less than two years left for the Paris Conference, it would be timely and befitting to start the formal negotiations on the elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text. We therefore believe that it is important to switch-over from the mode of open-ended consultations to a contact group format focusing on the six core elements mandated by decision 1/CP.17. The outcomes in a textual or written form should come from Parties in a Partydriven and consensus-building manner. Mr. Co-Chairs, The pre-2020 ambition must cover mitigation, adaptation and provision of finance and technology support to developing countries. We urge developed country Parties participating in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to revisit and significantly increase their emission reduction targets in 2014, and urge developed countries that are not part of the second commitment period to also revisit and raise the ambition of their commitments under the Convention within the same timeframe and in a comparable manner. If the developed countries had committed to an emission reduction of 40% below their 1990 levels by 2020, the pre-2020 mitigation gap would not even have existed. The 2014 Revisit as set out in para.7 to 11 of decision 1/CMP.8 and para.4(c) of decision 1/CP.19 should be fully and effectively implemented as soon as possible. Developed countries should also honour 3 and fulfill their commitments on providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries during the pre-2020 period. We also urge those Annex I Parties that have not put forward a pre-2020 quantified economy-wide emission reduction target to do so. We further note with concern that the mitigation contribution by developing country Parties is much greater than that by developed country Parties. The concern is not that developing countries are doing more than the developed countries but on the rather low ambition levels of developed countries. It is simply not acceptable that the commitments of developed countries should be transferred to developing countries and more so through initiatives outside the Convention. While we recognise the potential of international cooperative initiatives to advance our efforts to combat climate change, these initiatives must be treated in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Mr. Co-Chairs, We would like to reiterate our full commitment and support to you in taking the ADP process forward, with a view to making a balanced and comprehensive progress in an open and transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-building manner. I thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs. \"'],\n",
              "       ['55,2,4,4,20140310,eig,\"Mr. Co-Chair, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. Mr Co-Chair. First of all, the EIG would like to thank you and your Co-Chair for the informal note reflecting progress made during our last meeting and laying out your vision for this decisive year of ADP. The note captures very well the progress achieved and draws our attention on the next steps needed. The EIG supports your arrangements to continue in a informal setting with a focused technical expert discussion on areas with high mitigation potential, in parallel to a more political discussion on ADP agenda Item 3. We think that this discussion should focus on ADP WS 1 to allow maximum progress in identifying elements which will later this year be crystalized into draft text. Mr Co-Chair. The ADP here in Bonn must take a significant step towards the 2015 Agreement. This meeting should achieve at least three objectives: It should advance our common understanding of core elements of the 2015 outcome, including that it may include three levels: a legally binding instrument, COP decisions including guidelines, and nationally determined contributions. It should advance our confidence that all Parties will undertake the efforts needed to submit well in advance of COP21, by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so, their intended nationally determined contributions, and that most Parties will be able to do so. It should also advance our common understanding which information will have to be provided together with the intended nationally determined contributions, And finally, it should help each of us and all of us together to unlock opportunities for increasing efforts to reduce emissions before 2020. Mr Co-Chair. The discussions throughout this week will allow us to focus constructively on the central elements of the 2015 outcome. Let me highlight some of the elements which the EIG considers to be key for a success in Paris: The 2015 must provide a robust and credible framework for the global climate change regime post-2020. As agreed in Durban, it must ensure that all Parties formulate commitments, including targets or actions, based on the same legal form and on the same internationally agreed rules, at differentiated depth according to CBDR and RC. We need a rules-based - yet dynamic and flexible - and a committing regime with the participation of all Parties reflecting the changing economic realities, national circumstances, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. With the same priority, we must address adaptation under the 2015 Agreement - in a differentiated manner as required. The 2015 Agreement shall promote cooperation in adaptation in view to increase adaptive capacity and resilience of all Parties in the context of sustainable development. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement must be underpinned by adequate, integrated and transparent means of implementation. Based on a clear global vision on support, effective financial mechanism should be duly reflected in the 2015 Agreement and be operated from contributions from developed Parties and those in the position to do so according to their responsibilities, capacities and equity. The EIG is very concerned about the lack of progress of the work within the GCF Executive Board. We urge all the members of the GCF Executive Board to be fully commited and finalize the essential requirements of the GCF business model framework by the May meeting as scheduled. Mr Co-Chair. Pre-2020 Mitigation Ambition is another urgent workstream under the ADP. The current global mitigation ambition falls short from the recommendations by science to hold global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius - we have to strengthen international cooperation on immediate additional actions. (Here in Bonn we will be able to engage in a focused and technical work under the ADP workstream 2 examining concrete options to increase ambition on renewable energy and energy efficiency. At the same time,) we should further foster initiatives additional to the current mitigation commitments, such as those announced in Warsaw. Thank you, Mr Co-Chair. If process issues around contact groups will happen: The EIG is strongly commited to engage on substiantial matters under the ADP. It is the groups view that at this stage the continuation of the informal setting in two workstreams is most benefitial - the EIG does not support the creation of contact groups at this stage. \"'],\n",
              "       ['56,2,4,4,20140310,eu,\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We are now past the halfway stage in the life of the ADP and with less than two years to secure an ambitious 2015 Agreement at COP 21 in Paris, the work that lies before us is challenging and urgent. But that is a challenge that we must collectively meet. The positive result of COP19, and the spirit of compromise and cooperation which enabled that result, provides a good platform for our work in 2014. It is essential that we get down to business quickly and efficiently here in Bonn, bearing in mind the need for a draft negotiating text of the 2015 Agreement to emerge by Lima. In relation to work towards the 2015 Agreement, the EU sees that the priority for our work this week is to make progress towards agreeing the requirements for upfront information to be supplied with intended nationally determined mitigation contributions, so that they are transparent, quantifiable, comparable, verifiable and ambitious. Progress also needs to be made towards further elaborating the rules base of the 2015 Agreement - in particular the MRV and accounting rules that will be needed in the context of a variety of possible mitigation commitment types. Clearly adaptation and means of implementation will also need to be addressed this week. Several Parties, including the EU, have put forward ideas in these areas that could usefully form the basis of further and deeper discussions towards elaborating the elements of the 2015 Agreement. We very much welcome the inclusion of the workshop on the domestic preparations for intended nationally determined contributions. This will be an important opportunity to take stock of the work that countries have initiated on their contributions and to highlight some of the activities being undertaken to support countries in their preparations. The EU and its Member States have begun the process to prepare their mitigation contribution, and we look forward to sharing information on this and exchanging ideas with other Parties. The briefing by relevant organisations and UN agencies on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined contributions is also a welcome initiative to highlight the support that is available to those countries that need it. In relation to the work on raising the mitigation ambition of all Parties before 2020 we welcome the approach of convening technical expert meetings that focus on particular issues. Whilst energy efficiency and renewable energy are the focus for March, we look forward to other aspects being the focus of our work in June - for example REDD+ and the phasing down of HFCs. The EU would like to see a list of policy options emerging from the technical process that would be captured in the reflections note and inform an update of the Secretariat technical paper. Political leadership is essential to make progress in 2014 - a year the UN Secretary-General has dubbed the \"\"year of climate action\"\". We must take the opportunity to harness political will through the June Ministerial session, the UN Secretary General??s Leaders?? Summit in September, as well as COP 20 in Lima. In conclusion - we look forward to working in 2014 with our negotiating partners and the coChairs, building on the progress and outcomes achieved in Warsaw.\"'],\n",

The Group assures you of our willingness to continue to engage cooperatively with all Parties in this working Group to successfully accomplish the mandate that we have given ourselves. For this, we need to move beyond an exchange of ideas and engage in substantive negotiation. We trust that you as our co-Chairs will facilitate our work, based on decision 1/CP.17, 2/CP.18 and l/CP.19 towards elements for a draft negotiating text based on inputs and submissions by Partes. And toward enhanced ambition pre-2020 in accordance with the Durban Mandate. Mr. Co-Chairs, The successful accomplishment of work before us will require us to consider the elements and contributions in a comprehensive manner. The Group stresses the importance of giving balanced consideration to how all elements, not only mitigation, has a role to play in reaching a successful outcome. The consideration of the element of \"\"support\"\" is essential for the Group, particularly in the context of an \"\"ex-ante\"\" discussion on the elements and contributions of Parties and to understand how said support will be delivered in a predictable and accessible manner, to assist developing country Parties in accordance with principles and provisions of the Convention. The elements of support, in terms of finance, technology and capacity-building, are issues of ongoing discussions under the Convention, and our work must build upon these. Mr. Co-Chairs, A comprehensive consideration of the elements and contributions requires the consideration of adaptation actions and measures. The Group wishes to signal concern over the absence of adaptation in our discussions. We 1 urge Parties to give adaptation due consideration and likewise to all aspects of our work.  The Group approaches the substantive work ahead of us bearing in mind that the role of Parties can not be replaced. It is Parties that will have to reach an agreement. We must therefore avoid any mode of work that could take down the path of having to take important decisions in a manner that does not allow careful reflection and equal opportunity for all delegations, large or small. In this context, we take the opportunity to reiterate the six points raised last year on behalf of the Group as the Group position on ADP; a) The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles. and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; The negotiations under the ADP must be a party-driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and f) Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. Mr. Co-Chairs, In the work of the ADP under work-stream 2, as we have also stated previously, developed countries must demonstrate clear and unconditional leadership in mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology development and transfer. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China expects that the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol enter into force as soon as possible. It is paramount that the ambition mechanism launched in Doha effectively results in the increase of the ambition of Annex I Parties\\' quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments for the second commitment period. We therefore urge all Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to go through the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible, and to revisit and significantly increase their quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments by 2014. It is crucial that we should ensure the 2 operationalization and implementation of the 2014 Revisit Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol in Warsaw. We likewise urge non-KP Annex I Parties to increase their mitigation ambition in a comparable manner within the same timeframe. All Annex I Parties must undertake additional verifiable actions under the Kyoto Protocol, as well as under the Convention with a view to close the ambition gap by 2020. The enhanced commitments from the Annex I Parties in 2014 for the post-2020 period should be the first step, since this would directly impact the level of ambition in workstream 1 for the post-2020 period. The members of Group of 77 and China have made greater contributions on combating climate change than those of developed countries during the pre2020 period. We urge developed country Parties to fulfill and enhance their commitments on the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries, which is fundamental for developing countries to implement our actions on adaptation and mitigation. Mr. Co-Chairs. With these words, we would like to assure you of the Group\\'s continued cooperation and we look forward to engaging meaningfully with all our partners in the coming week. \"'],\n",

We associate with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China, Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, and Nauru on behalf of the AOSIS. We thank the Secretariat for the preparations made for this meeting and also thank the government and people of Germany for their warm hospitality as usual. Co-Chairs, we congratulate you for your excellent work in Warsaw. We welcome all your efforts to keep us up-to-date and up-to-speed through informal, scenario and reflection notes. We also appreciate \\x1cthe co-chairs corner\\x1d on the website informing us on your various inter-sessional activities. Co-chairs, our overall impression on the Warsaw ADP outcome is that it helped us to make progress under few elements, but it also pushed us back on some fundamental elements, including the legal perspective of the ADP outcome. We strongly believe that the final contributions of Parties should be anchored in the 2015 agreement in the form of commitments. We are also concerned that the deadline and the process for delivering pledges agreed in Warsaw is too late and does not allow sufficient time for review. Also, no formal process for such a review of pledges has been agreed. Co-Chairs, our tasks in Bonn include making the necessary arrangements to ensure high ambition upfront, when Parties make their first offers. Our aim should be to encourage earlier actions by the end of December 2014 for those countries that are willing and capable to do so. We look forward to hearing from Parties concerning the initiatives they are undertaking to prepare their national contributions. As LDCs, we do not have adequate capacity to undertake such preparations and will need support to enable us to do so. In Bonn, we must also strive to progress in refining elements for the draft negotiating text and make clear progress on the issue of the adequacy of both individual and aggregate mitigation commitments will be kept well below 1.5??C by the end of the century 9. Co-Chairs, on the short-term ambition (WS2), the LDCs strongly believe that Parties must accelerate the technical examination of actions with high mitigation potentials with a view to implement those actions as early as possible in area\"'],\n",
              "       ['59,2,4,4,20140310,lmdc,\"Good morning. The Philippines has the pleasure of making this opening statement on behalf of the LikeMinded Developing Countries (LMDC) in the UNFCCC. The LMDC fully supports the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, We are now more than halfway in the timeline of our journey together under the ADP from Durban in December 2011 to Paris in December 2015. In the past two years, we have had informal consultations among the Parties that gave us a better understanding of each other\\'s views, ideas, starting points, and objectives for this process. Divergences and convergences have emerged. The challenge clearly is on expanding convergence and narrowing divergence on the basis of consensus by shifting from an informal mode of work to a formal, transparent and participatory negotiating process of the Parties and by the Parties, as quickly as possible. The time for this is now. The common objective must be to active at an agreed outcome in Paris that is balanced, comprehensive, credible, legitimate, and acceptable to all, so that all will implement it. The outcome must be consistent with the Convention, enhances its full, effective and sustained implementation, and avoids re-writing or reinterpreting any of its provisions or principles. Most importantly, the principles of equity and CBDR must remain the bedrock of the 2015 agreed outcome. At the same time, however, despite the long-standing commitments of developed country Parties under the Convention since 1992, the effects of their historical responsibility for emissions coupled by the lack or inadequacy of their efforts on climate change are now making themselves deeply felt through the acceleration and widening of the adverse effects of climate change on our peoples. Many developing countries of the LMDC and of our broader family, the G77, are suffering massively from these adverse effects. This highlights the urgency that we must all feel in carrying out our work under the ADP. This also underlines the need for developed country Parties to finally take up the mantle of leadership that they have long been called to take up under the Convention, rather than seeking to escape from it or transferring the responsibility to those who still face major sustainable development and poverty eradication challenges. This includes, in particular, ratifying Annex I Parties no later than the end of 2014 the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol with respect to its second commitment period so that it can enter into force as soon as possible before 2020. Co-Chairs, For any agreed outcome to be credible and legitimate, it must be the product of a formal, transparent and participatory negotiating process driven by the Parties in which the Parties negotiate with each other on the basis of good faith and in the spirit of mutual understanding. At this session of the ADP, formal and structured intergovernmental negotiations on the elements for a draft negotiating text of the 2015 agreed outcome must start through the establishment by the ADP of a contact group for Workstream I focusing on the six core elements referred to in the Durban and Doha mandate, ie. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. The proceedings of this contact group must be open to observers. They, too, have a stake in this process. Through such formal negotiations, a negotiating text should be developed from a compilation transparently drawn from and attributed to Parties\\' textual submissions. We emphasize that only formal negotiations in a contact group can ensure that our substantive discussions under the ADP are proceeding in the right direction to Paris so that we can adopt a balanced agreed outcome by the end of COP21 in 2015. The negotiations in the contact group under the ADP must follow a logical sequence as stated in paragraph 2(a) of decision 1/CP 19. It must start with further elaborating, beginning at its first session in 2014, the elements identified in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17 for a draft negotiating text, followed by negotiations on contributions, and then on information. In this context, the provision of support by developed countries to developing countries for their domestic preparations with respect to information on their contributions is necessary and must be done in a timely and adequate manner. The provision of support is a concrete commitment by developed country Parties rather than those of international organizations. Co-Chairs, in this negotiating process, we expect you to allow and provide time for Parties and their groups to coordinate and consult within and among themselves. Your facilitation of this process as the ADP CoChairs is important to us. Any guidance from you, such as questions that you put to us like those in paragraphs 13 to 17 of your scenario note, should be balanced. The questions to be discussed in the negotiations are directly related to the substance. Such questions should follow the mandate from Durban and Doha and be determined by all Parties in a Party-driven and consensus.building 1nanner, in order to reflect different concerns and views of all Parties in a balanced manner. We stress that procedures or processes that are non-participatory or nontransparent, or which limit effective involvement to only a few Parties rather than all the Parties, must be avoided. No less than the chance of actually having a 2015 agreed outcome, as well as the credibility, legitimacy, and acceptability of such outcome, are at stake. Co-Chairs, The LMDC has just inade a submission on the elements for the 2015 agreed outcome. In our submission, we have outlined the way in which the elements of the 2015 agreed outcome - namely mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building, and transparency of action and support - could be fleshed out in a manner that is fully consistent with the principles, provisions, structure and annexes of the Convention, builds on previous COP decisions, and leads to enhanced action by all Parties to achieve the objective of the Convention. In mitigation, there should be CBDR-based differentiation between developed and developing countries, MRV of support, and response measures. Under adaptation, Annex II parties should fulfill their commitments to support developing countries to address the adverse effects of climate change, including loss and damage as well as economic diversification. The other elements under finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support, should also be enhanced consistent with the Convention. In short, our submission points the way by which an equitable, ambitious, and effective outcome can be achieved in Paris by the end of COP21 in a manner that respects the mru1date of the ADP, enhances implementation of the Convention, and enhances international cooperation and don1estic contributions by all Parties fully in accordance with the provisions and principles of the Convention, in particular equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The way that we have suggested will allow us to reach a balanced, comprehensive, and satisfactory agreement within the timeline to Paris that remains to us under the ADP. However, proposals that are not consistent with the Convention, or which seek to rewrite or re-interpret it, are not helpful to the process that we are in. They only cause delay and confusion, and will drastically reduce the possibility of reaching a credible, legitimate, and acceptable outco1ne in Paris by the end of COP21. Co-Chairs, With regards to Workstream 2, enhancing pre-2020 ambition holistically includes mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology transfer. It should be achieved through the implementation of the Bali outcomes. The pre-2020 mitigation gap would be closed if developed country Parties committed to an aggregate emission reduction of more than 40o/o below their 1990 levels by 2020, even as developing countries are already contributing more to global mitigation efforts than developed countries. All developed country Parties should revisit and increase their pre-2020 mitigation ambition in order to set a high starting point and reference level for determining their post-2020 mitigation commitments. While technical expert meetings help implement paragraph 5 of decision l/CP.19, we would like to emphasize that paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of this COP decision should be addressed in a balanced manner. Enough space and time slots in the ADP process should be secured to discuss the issue of the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of decision l/CP.19 in 2014. International cooperative initiatives may facilitate the implementation by developing countries of their presented actions but should not transfer to developing countries the commitments and obligations of developed countries. The LMDC, representing developing countries whose populations daily face the multidimensional challenges of achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty while at the same time addressing the adverse effects of climate change, wish to see positive progress in our negotiations under the ADP. We wish to see success crown our collective efforts Wlder the ADP, first at COP20 in Lima this year in elaborating the elements and then at COP21 in Paris with respect to an agreed outcome. To this end, Co-Chairs, we will continue to be constructive and positively engaged with you and our partners in order to collectively construct a better future for us and for future generations under the Convention. Thank you, Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",
              "       ['60,2,4,4,20140310,umbrella,\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. The ADP has set itself a full agenda this year and we have limited opportunities to advance work. So consistent with the ADP Co-Chair\\'s scenario note, we are ready to get to work immediately on the key tasks for the year: We look forward to working with parties here to identify elements for a 2015 agreement. Taken together, those elements should create an ambitious, inclusive and durable agreement, which requires all Parties to the agreement to put forward nationally-determined mitigation contributions, and which all Parties can view as being fair, including through an exchange of information about intentions for planning and managing the process. We are also ready to begin the process of identifying the up-front information that needs to accompany Parties\\' national contributions to ensure that they are clear, transparent, and quantifiable. What we all need to do in an efficient way, is to develop a better understanding of assumptions underpinning these contributions. We envision a simple list of essential elements that Parties should submit to make sure that Parties understand what others are contributing. Back home, we are examining how to elaborate our intended nationally determined contributions, so as to meet the timetable we agreed in Warsaw, and we\\'ve been working to identify avenues to support the efforts of other countries as they prepare intended nationally determined contributions that fit their national circumstances and capabilities. And, finally, we will be coming together to contemplate further steps to advance practical climate action in the period to 2020 by sharing our experiences and understanding how we can best build further action. There are many options to choose from, and the technical expert meetings should give us the time and space to focus our attention on areas of untapped mitigation. We do not start these tasks from scratch, but should build on the constructive work of the last two years and accelerate the process to meet this timeframe. In this time, we have started to hear growing areas of convergence on where the 2015 agreement can promote ambitious mitigation action. As we go forward, we need a process that is flexible enough to allow for deeper investigation of specific concepts and ideas, but which ensures that the 2015 agreement continues to develop as a coherent whole. In coming to an elements text we will need to give further thought to the form and structure of a 2015 agreement, considering what elements are best placed in a durable core agreement and which can be developed in parallel decisions and outcomes. We will also need to come to a common understanding about how to give effect to the principles of the Convention, in a way that is appropriate to an agreement that will start in 2020 and potentially operate for decades beyond. With respect to CB DR/RC in particular, a binary approach to differentiation will not serve this purpose. We will need a more nuanced approach that allows fill countries to participate in climate action in a way that fits their individual national circumstances, complements their economic advancement plans and priorities, and allows continuous evolution and improvement as circumstances and capacities evolve. Co-Chairs. In workstream 2, we have engaged constructively in conversations on initiatives to h.elp enhance pre-2020 mitigation ambition, and heard many examples of the action that is taking place. We look forward to participating this week in deeper technical exchanges on renewable energy and energy efficiency and sharing our experiences. We recognise that all countries need to act further to help close the gap between current pledges and what is required to meet the below 2-degree goal. We also welcome the opportunity to further engage business, civil society, and various issue experts on the ways and initiatives to drive innovative mitigation and adaptation efforts in the short term. Many countries have acted in a variety of ways to reduce emissions, and we must continue to incentivise further action. We also continue to encourage countries that have not yet made a 2020 pledge- including 20 of the top 50 emitters - to do so. These countries represent some 17% of global emissions, compared to the around 10% of emissions now covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Co-Chairs. We appreciate the guidance you continue to provide to our process and we look forward to working with you and others in a productive session here in Bonn. Thank You.\"'],\n",
              "       ['61,2,4,4,20140314,umbrella,\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of Countries. This week, we have made progress sharing views on the emerging elements of the 2015 Agreement, and sharing lessons on technical options for pursuing untapped renewable energy and energy efficiency potential. Like others, we are conscious that we are now more than halfway through our process and that we need to target our work toward delivering the Warsaw Decision in line with the timetable agreed in Durban. We want to expedite work on substance, and accelerate progress to meet our goals. This will require further focused work in the ADP that lets us build convergence on elements for the 2015 agreement. It will require more focused work at the next session to provide guidance on the up-front information to accompany post-2020 nationally determined contributions. Each country will need to continue progressing national preparations to bring forward an intended nationally determined contribution in line with the timeline agreed in Warsaw. And we also look forward to advancing work on further technical options for capturing mitigation potential. We like others highlight the importance of a Party driven process. We as Parties agreed on a set of Decisions in Warsaw and we will have to work together to deliver it, under your guidance. As you have described it, we understand the basis on which Parties have agreed to move forward under the modality of a Contact Group as being: A Contact Group will be established here today and we will resume in this format at our session in June; This Contact Group will be established to consider our existing agenda, including both workstreams of the ADP}and you will continue to facilitate the Contact Group as CoChair4 It will proceed in line with our current organisation of work which is to continue to advance workstream 1 in a single group for all Parties and observers, and workstream 2 through technical and other meetings; Time will be given at June to each of the tasks decided at Warsaw, covering the elements of the 2015 agreement, up-front information and technical work to raise ambition; The Warsaw Decision is to develop elements for a negotiating text. We see the best way for us to move toward convergence is to focus our efforts on thinking about elements for text, rather than entering into a detailed text compilation exercise. Elements for text will be developed based on the views provided by Parties in their written submissions and also during the course of negotiations, noting it is just as important to capture the work we have done in session to develop the elements of the 2015 agreement. And as we move forward we will maintain an integrated and coherent approach to the 2015 agreement, which does not approach work though silo-ed thematic elements, but looks at how elements can functionally be brought together into a 2015 agreement and broader package, in a way that considers overarching issues of form and structure.

              "       ['62,2,4,4,20140314,alba,\"Thank you. Co-Presidents. We make the following statement on behalf of the countries of the Alliance Bolivarian for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). We associate ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 + China and for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in Representation of the Group of Countries in the Development of Like Ideas. ALBA highlights the importance that this country has for our countries process and our wish that these negotiations in the framework of the Durban Platform achieve the results that our peoples they demand: having concrete and effective results so that the developed countries make effective commitments to mitigating climate change and the climate debt to developing countries. At ALBA we are committed to advancing a process that this framed in the Convention, to fully contemplate all its principles and provisions, the Common Responsibilities But Differentiated and Equity, and that allows reversing the effects of global warming that is already severely occurring in our countries with increasing frequency and severity. We consider that a positive signal is necessary at the next meeting ministerial to be held in June this year on the levels of ambition under the Kyoto Protocol. On the eve of The commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol is unfortunate that there are still no positive signs from the countries Annex I in relation to the commitment to comply with the historical responsibilities and with the legal obligation that they acquired from sign the Kyoto Protocol. To date, it has not been produced by Annex I countries ratification of the Doha amendment to the Protocol from Kyoto. The countries of Annex I, which are part of the second period of commitments and the rest of developed countries, must show the leadership in reducing emissions and in complying with commitments made under the Convention due to climate debt that developed countries have before humanity for the overexploitation of common global resources, such as the atmosphere, assuming the debt and historical responsibility that the countries developed have before humanity and Mother Earth. Paradoxically, the measures proposed by the countries responsible for climate change are still pointed in the direction of rescuing the system that has caused the problem. ALBA considers it important that for the next session in June establish adequate spaces that allow the Parties to negotiate between Parties and to be able to get to Lima with the negotiating text of the Parties themselves. To do this, the organization of negotiations in the next session in June is essential, so that it allows a structured contact group that is balanced, transparent and inclusive and under the absolute mandate of the Parties. ALBA expresses its disagreement with the way they have been carried out the negotiations at this ADP session in Bonn, which undermine the foundations of multilateral negotiation, since the decisions that should be taken the first day, such as establishing a contact group, just are taken on the last day of this session. It is also observed the real contribution that the Expert Groups may have to the prioritize only mitigation and propose mostly measures domestic that would require large national resources that are so necessary for the eradication of poverty of our peoples, and without there is still clarity about the ambition in technology transfer, financing and capacity building. Mr. Co Presidents. We hope that the June session program will meet expectations of work, methodology and modalities expressed here. ALBA reiterates its full commitment, with the achievement of a fair agreement and balanced according to the principles of the Convention, which ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promote the urgent adaptation to climate change and compensation for damage and lost, and the integrity of our Mother Earth is respected. Finally, on behalf of ALBA we want to thank the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region for recognition and full support from the Latin American and Caribbean region to the efforts of the democratically elected government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as well as its support in the preparations to celebrate the First Social Pre-COP of the Convention, before Lima. Thank you Mr. Co-Presidents. \"'],\n",
              "       ['63,2,4,4,20140314,basic,\"Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of BASIC. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, As we close the proceedings for this session, we are concerned about the slow progress we are making towards the tasks assigned to us by the Durban mandate, Doha and the Warsaw decisions. We came to Bonn with a clear intent to engage in an open and transparent, inclusive and party-driven inter-governmental negotiations on the initial elaboration of elements of a draft negotiating text as identified in para 5 of decision 1/CP.17. However, unfortunately it seems that this session has seen a further reiteration of ideas and positions already outlined at the roundtables and workshops during the last two years rather than the initial elaboration of elements of a draft negotiating text. Therefore, we are of the view that it is important to rapidly move into a clearly structured formal negotiation process in a contact group setting. Co-Chairs, We would like to request for further clarity regarding the plan and mode of work of this proposed Contact group in order to start negotiating on the substantial elements at the June session. To us, the work of the Contact group must be conducted in a formal and structured manner on the basis of text-based negotiations. As usual, the text will come from the parties by way of submissions or textual proposals during negotiations. We believe that sufficient and balanced negotiating time must be allocated for negotiations on all six core elements of a draft negotiating text covering mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support. Co-Chairs, The BASIC Group would also request for a clear plan of work for the remaining meetings of the ADP up to COP 20 in Lima in order to enable delegations to prepare for the sessions and make submissions accordingly. We must also note that in our future plan of work, due consideration must be given to discussions on para 3 & 4 of the Warsaw decision and in selection of areas of high-mitigation potential for technical expert meetings. Co-Chairs, With regard to more substantive issues, we concur with the common understanding, voiced by developing countries that the term \\'nationally determined contributions\\' covers all the operational pillars of the Convention, i.e mitigation, adaptation, financial, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support for developing country implementation. In this regard, our understanding of the objective of the final 2015 agreement must have at its core the strengthening and enhancement of the implementation of the provisions of the Convention, in particular its Article 4, in a manner that gives full effect to its principles, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Therefore, our contention is that the commitments included in the NDCs for the developed country parties will, for mitigation, retain the already agreed form of commitment, namely quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and in addition developed country NDC\\'s should clearly define their commitments to the provision of finance, technology development and transfer as well as capacity building support to enable developing country implementation of the Convention. Given the recognition in the Convention that developing countries have overriding priorities to address poverty, it is already agreed that their contribution to the global climate change effort and therefore their NDCs are in the context of sustainable development. In this regard, the 2015 agreement must incorporate the recognition of the Convention that the extent to which developing countries will be able to meet their commitments is dependent on the extent to which developed countries meet their financial and technological as well as capacity-building support commitments in accordance with Article 4.7 of the Convention. Given the diversity of types of actions and commitments of developing countries as opposed to the quantified emission reduction targets of developed countries, it is a common understanding of developing countries that the information to facilitate the understanding of the contributions are necessarily differentiated between developed and developing countries. Therefore, we would once again strongly emphasize our proposal for the 2015 agreement to build upon the structure of the Convention, in order to strengthen and enhance the implementation of its provisions, in accordance with its principles and through the institutions and structures built over the years. We should therefore move into a formal mode of negotiation in the June session to build understanding on elements of the draft negotiation text keeping in mind the above conceptual articulation that under-pin proposals from developing countries. Co-Chairs. We highly appreciate the fact that you were always accessible to listen to our proposals, suggestions and concerns. On behalf of the BASIC Group, you can be rest assured of our continued and constructive engagement with all groups and parties as well as our full support to you in this crucial phase of upcoming formal negotiations.

First of all, we wish to associate ourselves with the intervention made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Presidents. AILAC thanks you for the efforts and hard work you have put into guiding our discussions and our work. We have had a very productive week in which we have had the opportunity to understand each other better, advance the ideas we are working on, and start the process of defining those that They will be the details of the future legally binding agreement. Informal consultations helped us to have more clarity on the six elements included in the Durban\\'s decision, as well as the architecture of the future agreement. The technical meetings of experts They also made it possible to advance in the identification of specific examples that will contribute to our work under work-stream 2. We see two challenges on the way forward: First, we see the need to advance the transition to a new way of working in Junia with caution and good judgment. This transition brings with it the challenge of starting to discuss the draft text of negotiation to be agreed in Lima at COP20. This will require that we have a strong sense of appropriation against the text that we work, and that at the same time define an efficient, rational way of working, and that allows us to deliver optimal results. Second, we must identify the elements that will allow us to raise expectations under the work-stream 2, going from a technical initial phase, to a political phase through which we can achieve an impact significant to increase the level of ambition in pre-2020 mitigation and financing. Co-Presidents, AILAC continues ready to continue working to face these challenges, and to accelerate the process that allow to have results in Lima. We are encouraged by the fact that we will arrive in June ready to start the work noun immediately. It also encourages hearing so many voices around the table that they are ready to work this way. We fully trust that you will guide and assist us, as we have been doing, to achieve this objective. In accordance with the position expressed by the G77 president, we are convinced that starting the June meeting as the fifth part of the second ADP session, under a single contact group, is the way forward. We are confident that this will allow all of us, the States parties, to continue enriching our understanding of the issues to be addressed, and to begin to engage in frank negotiations that will allow us to pave the way for the adoption of a draft text at COP20 in Lima.

We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China as well as Sudan on behalf of the LDCs. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for conducting such an effective session this week and assure you of the full trust and confidence we have in your leadership. We welcome the agreement to establish a contact group at the next meeting and look forward to making further progress under both Workstreams at the June session under our existing ADP agenda, as agreed here at this session. Co-Chairs, The opening of the technical expert groups under Workstream 2 this week provided a new opportunity to focus our discussions on the many opportunities available to enhance mitigation ambition in the short-term. We heard about some of the exciting steps countries are already taking in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency. These success stories demonstrate that the solutions to climate change are well within reach. This progress and emerging policy options should be captured in an update of our technical paper, and inform the ministerial discussions in June, in turn paving the way to the ramping up of ambition and the announcement of bold new initiatives and actions at the UN Secretary-General\\'s Summit in September. Co-Chairs, We were also able to deepen our discussions about the 2015 agreement under Workstream 1. As we emphasized repeatedly this week the level of ambition for the 2015 agreement, in light of the most recent science, is absolutely critical to our group. Our members are already suffering severe climate impacts, including devastating king tides that struck the Marshall Islands just last week and recent droughts in the Caribbean, which severely impacted Saint Lucia, Dominica, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines. These impacts have resulted in millions of dollars of damage to our small economies. Our response must be driven by a real sense of urgency. With this in mind, we would like to see the June session focus on the following areas:  A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the final 2015 agreement; Rapid progress on identifying the information parties need to present with their nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates better clarity, transparency, and a clearer understanding of the proposed commitments; And Agreement on a robust and transparent process to assess and review the adequacy and fairness of proposed commitments against the long-term global goal of holding warming below 1.5C, before the commitments are inscribed in the new legally-binding agreement. In addition, the 2015 agreement MUST contain adequate provision for long term, scaled up, predictable, new and additional finance to support adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change. This should complement the necessary transfer of technology and provisions for capacity building. Co-Chairs, Loss and Damage must be a separate element to be reflected under the new agreement. It should form a separate area of negotiation and warrants specific discussion in a separate session. The establishment of an International Mechanism to address Loss and Damage in Warsaw represents an important step and while our work continues there, addressing loss and damage is a reality for AOSIS and must be part of the 2015 agreement. The Warsaw International Mechanism must also be anchored in the new agreement. There is much work to accomplish in a very short period of time, so as we have said previously, holding an additional meeting in October will be critical to ensure continued progress on these priority areas in both Workstreams, and to fulfill the mandates we have from the COP.

We are looking back on an intense week of negotiations and Technical Expert Meetings. We have covered both Work Streams, fostering the mutual understanding of our positions and of the potential for increased action on climate change. The Technical Expert Meetings, with a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energies, have allowed putting forward concepts, strategies and specific projects to raise pre-2020 ambition. We thank all facilitators and panelists, as well as all the participants for their active engagement. We look forward to continuing on this important path at the next session of the ADP this coming June. Sharing our experiences and the important lessons we have learnt is crucial to combat climate change, and this already in the short run.This past week has equally been markedly shaped by the negotiations on WorkStream 1: The EIG continues to greatly value the leadership of you, the ADP CoChairs, in this important process. We also value the active contribution of all the Parties and their negotiation groups. The EIG member countries believe that we leave Bonn with a yet better understanding of our mutual visions, and with the assurance that we have achieved progress in developing the elements of the 2015 Agreement. This past week, the EIG has put forward its specific views and positions in the various sessions dedicated to particular topics - and we want to refrain from reiterating them here. We just like to briefly refer to the discussions on some of the transversal issues we had yesterday. While we expect to delve more into these matters at the next sessions, we just like to make a very few points: The EIG believes that the cross-cutting or transversal issues should include some fundamentals and principles, including ensuring that the 2015 agreement does not exacerbate social inequalities or environmental degradation of any kind. In dealing with environmental issues, we should be aware that this must inherently also address current disparities. Parallel to our efforts, the Human Rights Council is closely looking into the relationship between Human Rights and Climate Change. It is important that our work takes these concerns fully into account, as we have done earlier in the Cancun Agreements. EIG member countries are committed to further integrate gender in the realm of climate change negotiations. Indeed, climate change impacts affect us all. However, due to their varying social roles and livelihood activities, impacts of climate change on women and men often differ. Therefore, it is important to address the gender-aspect of climate change and to take the specific perspectives and needs of women and men duly into account. The correlation between gender and development or between gender gap and development gap have already been proven, so gender equality 2 ADP Bonn March 2014 - Final Statement by EIG should be a fundamental principle of the 2015 Agreement to ensure effective global actions that trigger mitigation, adaptation and the provision of means of implementation. In this regard, gender equality should be part of the overall principles to guide the instrumentation of actions to follow. To end, the EIG wishes to thank you, the Co-Chairs, all other delegations as well as the representatives of civil society for their support and willingness to engage in fruitful discussions this past week. We also wish to thank the Secretariat for the continued support. We highly appreciate your efforts around the clock. And last, we do not want to forget the hospitality of the host country and of the city of Bonn. We always feel welcome here and we look forward to seeing you all again in a few months.

The open-ended consultations that you put us through this week, rather than actually starting formal and structured negotiations among the Parties, have called for the exercise of patience, forbearance and understanding. We have actively participated and carefully listened these exchanges of information this week. However, the time for these exchanges is past and progress is now needed. We have to move forward. The urgency of the situation demands it. The future of our peoples, all over the world, requires it. Co-Chairs, We cannot afford to waste either time or money, in our meetings, particularly when every day millions of people in our developing countries continue to be highly affected by climate change impacts. We must now truly negotiate. We must now make use of the little time left for us to have concrete deliverables for Lima, on the road to Paris. Only the formal and structured negotiation through the Contact Group can help us make progress towards the elements for a draft negotiating text in Lima and achieve a successful, balanced and comprehensive agreed outcome in Paris. We look forward to now doing our work in a structured and formal mode of work in the Contact Group that we have established at this session under the ADP, covering both workstreams and focusing on the elements. There must be a clear plan of work for the remaining meetings of the ADP up to COP20 in Lima that clearly outlines for the Parties the issues and topics to be negotiated in the Contact Group. It must provide for sufficient negotiating time to be equally distributed among all the six core elements for a draft negotiating text - mitigation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transiency of action and support. This plan of work must be communicated to Parties well in advance, so as to avoid procedural debates and to enable agreed direct negotiation. Co-Chairs. The modalities of work should allow Parties to put their textual proposals early on in the process on the table to be compiled and provide them the possibility to negotiate their way forward together to an outcome that has been collectively produced. All Parties know what they are doing in this process. We all know that what is at stake is no less than our ability today to provide for today\\'s generations and to create a better future for future generations. With such high stakes, it is our individual and collective duty to make sure that we responsibly negotiate with each other as Parties, in good faith, without fear or pressure, on the basis of equality, with full respect for national sovereignty, and in a fully transparent and participatory manner. We look to you, Co-Chairs, to help Parties undertake this kind of negotiations together. When we negotiate in this way, Co-Chairs, we ensure that the results at COP20 and the agreed outcome at COP21 will, in fact, be collectively produced and agreed to by the Parties. This is fundamental to the integrity, credibility, and legitimacy of the outcome. Because we own it, we will implement it. Only in this way can success be achieved at Lima and Paris. Any other outcome produced in any other manner will not be acceptable. As had been expressed by the Philippines during this week, we would much rather have a comprehensive and balanced text thoroughly negotiated that we own as the agreed outcome, rather than a short text hurriedly negotiated that we do not own. The work under workstream 2 is not just about mitigation. The pre-2020 ambition also includes in addition to mitigation, the Bali Action Pan pillars of adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building as well. Hence, there needs to be a comprehensive and balanced treatment of all these issues as well in Worksteam 2, which must be addressed in a formal way in the ADP process. Co-Chairs, The LMDC continues to be committed, together with other members of the Group of 77 and China, with the help of civil society and the public, to produce by COP21 in Paris a balanced, comprehensive, and equitable agreed outcome, under the Convention and reflecting its principles and provisions, and which allows us to achieve the objective of the Convention together. This must be an outcome that will create a better future, a better world, for our countries and our peoples, particularly those of us living in developing countries. It must be an outcome that enables us to effectively combat climate change and its adverse effects in an equitable manner under the Convention and to achieve sustainable development. Towards this objective, Co-Chairs, you can count on the continued active, constructive, progressive, and positive engagement and involvement of the developing countries in the LMDC in these negotiations. Finally, Co-Chairs, on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as well as the LMDC, I look forward to welcoming all of you to the first-ever \"\"Social Pre-COP\"\" that will be held in Caracas this November with a preparatory international meeting in July. This \"\"Social Pre-COP\"\" will enable social movements and civil society organizations to come together and interact, make their voices heard, and provide their valuable inputs from the grassroots into this process. Thank you, Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",

The Member States of the Integration System Central American (SICA), we attended the negotiations in the framework of the ADP maintaining our commitment and we insist that develop in a transparent, participatory, open and inclusive way, respecting the principles and objectives of the Convention, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The SICA countries highlight our regional status highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which every year generate serious consequences and negative impacts for our life and development, as recognized in the recent report on extreme events presented by the IPCC. These effects represent a serious threat to the food security of the population, direct impact on socio-economic dynamics, public finances of the countries of the region and our competitiveness countries, year after year, we are forced to divert resources financial that we need for the eradication of poverty, the sustainable development, and to make viable what we recognize today as urgent and forced adaptation. We ratify our disposition before the international community in promoting national actions to reduce vulnerability and the search and implementation of an effective adaptation under the principles of the Convention. We make an urgent appeal to all the Parties and especially to the developed countries, to establish commitments and concrete actions to address the existing pre-2020 ambition gap and especially, how to address financial support, training and access to technology to promote these actions in our towns. We also reiterate our commitment to work jointly with all the Parties, by a binding agreement in 2015, according to the Durban Platform in 1 / CP 17, in accordance with principles and objectives of the Convention towards the goal of a 2C and even bring it up to 1.5C levels, following the guidelines dictated by science. We consider it indispensable and opportune to discussions next June in a more formal and structured way. For this we support the formation of a contact group that address (Workstream 1 and WS 2). And that a clear and balanced work program for this contact group that covers all meetings from June until the closing of COP 20 in Lima. We return to our countries to continue the work and resume our negotiations in this same city next June, to continue contributing our work to build the elements of the Agreement to be signed at COP21. Dear Co-Chairs, We reiterate our call to developed countries to comply with the financing and support commitments acquired under the Convention and we urge that the commitment for the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund, continue our long-term financing negotiations and guarantee their implementation underway in order to meet the most urgent needs of developing countries, guaranteeing the equitable distribution of these resources between adaptation and mitigation. The SICA countries, we express our commitment and availability to continue working to lay the foundations for a ambitious, durable and effective 2015 agreement, which should reflect the balance of all the elements and adaptation actions and mitigation and being flexible with our different circumstances nationals. The SICA countries, we recognize the importance of celebrating the Second Dialogue of Art.6 on Education to be held this year having as central theme Public Participation in the taking of decisions and climate change initiatives. We reiterate that without educated citizens we cannot achieve sustainable development. Finally, Co-Presidents, we want to ratify our solidarity with all those countries that are experiencing negative consequences of the adverse effects of climate change and who have the urgency and the need to obtain concrete commitments and effective as soon as possible in the negotiations international climate. Our populations cannot continue waiting. Thank you so much.\"'],\n",
              "       ['69,2,4,4,20140314,g77china,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, The work we have developed this week has generated important inputs for the process of negotiation and will contribute to its progress. This session had offered an opportunity to engage all the Parties in a process of sharing visions, information, policies and technical experiences applied on the ground; allowing us to have a better understanding of different issues. The outputs are useful to identify areas of common understanding. This exercise allows us to further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text by Lima in a formal negotiating mode. We understand the need to work under the formalities and applied rules of procedure as are established under the Convention, we believe that we should not lose sight of the urgency of accelerating the process in which we are. We have a duty to deliver a document that sends the world a message that this process is contributing to build agreements in order to protect the climate system, the mankind and the mother earth. The Group called for a more structured and formal mode of negotiations that would enhance the participation of the Parties in further elaborating elements for a draft negotiating text toward achieving the concrete outcomes mandated by the COP17, COP18 and COP19. In doing so, the Group sought to prioritize the work that needs to be completed by Lima, while making progress towards finalizing the text of the future agreement in time for adoption in Paris. Pursuant to Decision 1/CP.19 adopted at Warsaw, the members of the Group of 77 and China committed themselves to progressing the work at the June session of the ADP to further elaborate elements for a draft negotiating text; including, inter alia; on mitigation, adaptation, loss & damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support. We welcome the establishment of a Contact Group and moving to a formal Party-driven process. We request the Co-Chairs to facilitate the process and to present a scenario note with a clear plan of work for the June session and the subsequent sessions for 2014, and the Group considers this essential to move forward and make progress quickly. Mr. Co-Chairs, As before the Group continues to stress that outcomes must be guided by the provisions and the principles of the UNFCCC and be balanced and legitimate to all Parties, and further stresses that the process should be designed and conducted in a manner that inspires confidence. Co-Chairs, We believe it will be important to have a session in October, before the COP 20, and to advance in June, making as much progress as possible, so that we can guarantee the session to take place before the COP in Lima. Mr. Co-Chairs, We enter this phase of our discussions to negotiate in good faith, and will work under your able facilitation, towards an outcome that will serve all our interests in a balanced manner. The Group expresses to you our support for that purpose. The members of the Group of 77 and China are of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. It should strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention in order to achieve its ultimate objective. In this regard, the Group of 77 and Chi.na express our committed to continue our work in the June session of the ADP with a view to delivering the mandated elements for a draft negotiating text in Lima. Thank you very much.\"'],\n",

I am delivering this statement on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member State. Dear co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends We have this week worked on substance in relation to both workstreams under our agenda. In the context of our work on the 2015 Agreement, we have had a rich discussion on what Parties consider as important in relation to achieving effective adaptation and climate resilience. We will need to further deepen our understanding on how adaptation can best be reflected in the final agreement. We have also had a good and substantial debate on climate finance. In our discussions on this issue this year it will be important to keep focus on how to transform all financial flows such that we can move towards low carbon climate resilient societies. It is also important to emphasise that the EU has, is and will continue to deliver climate finance. In our discussions on mitigation we have heard that all Parties must act in order to achieve the below 2\\'C objective. Furthermore we have heard that all Parties must act in accordance with national circumstances, and evolving responsibilities and capabilities. The EU supports these views. Future global efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases must be enhanced from current levels and by all Parties in a way that is fair and ambitious. In that context many Parties have mentioned the need to have an international process to consider, before COP 21, the aggregate level of ambition represented by intended nationally determined mitigation contributions in order to ensure that we stay on track for our below 2\\'C objective. In order to do so, we need to have clarity around Parties\\' intended mitigation contributions. In that context it is encouraging to note the wide call from across the negotiations to identify - as agreed - up front information requirements by Lima. This is vital in order to ensure that proposed contributions are transparent, quantifiable, comparable, verifiable and ambitious. A number of Parties - developed and developing - elaborated on constructive proposals for what this means in practice. A priority for June must be to make further progress on this. We have also heard further elaboration from developed and developing countries for what the rules base - in particular MRV and accounting - could look like in the 2015 Agreement, in the context of a variety of possible mitigation commitment types. Such a rules base is critical to ensuring that the below 2\\'C objective is achieved. Making further progress on this must be also be a priority for June. All Parties agree that the work and outcome of the ADP is and will be under the Convention, including its principles. Going forward we need to consider more deeply how this can be operationalised in a practical manner and in relation to all elements of our work towards the 2015 Agreement. Enhancing pre 2020 mitigation ambition by all Parties is also a crucial part of our work. We are encouraged by the positive and constructive manner in which all Parties have engaged in the Technical Expert Meetings on renewables and energy efficiency. We have heard appetite for cooperation between Parties. The energy sector is an area with enormous, cost-effective mitigation potential, which can best be realised if we work together to exploit opportunities and overcome the barriers. We found the technical expert meetings to be a very helpful mode of work ? and one that can yield genuine results. We expect that the summaries of our rich discussions, and the lists of policy options, will be captured through the Chairs?? summaries or reflections, and used as an input to the Secretariat technical paper. We look forward to the continuation of the technical expert meetings in June - and we have outlined a number of ways in which this could be done. We encourage the Secretariat to assist Parties in their preparations by making the agenda available well in advance of the June session. We would expect to continue our discussions on the energy sector, and would also \"'],\n",
              "       ['71,2,5,5,20140604,ag,\"Co-chairs, I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. Allow me at the outset to express our appreciation to the Government of Germany for hosting this meeting, and for the Convention\\'s Secretariat for its excellent arrangements. The African Group associates itself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group 77 and China. The African Group would like to thank the Co-Chairs for the guidance provided on how they intend to proceed with the 5th part of the 2nd session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, the ADP 2. As has been the practice, the Co-chairs hold pre-sessional consultations with various Groups to further shape the organisation of work in the session, and it is of great concern that the Group hasn\\'t had the benefit of such a consultation, particularly in such an important session where our Ministers will also be present 3. The Group has concerns on a number of issues, and we believe clarity and resolution of those issues is indispensable prior to the contact group commencing with its work, as Parties must have a common understanding of what will be the outcome of this session. It is our understanding that the work of the ADP under work stream I has two major tasks, the first being work towards a decision in Lima, capturing the 1 elements of the draft negotiating text, and a decision capturing the information and format Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions 5. Co~Chairs1 inn working towards elements of the negotiating text, we would like to bring the following to your attention: We need to have a clearer view of how the work will be organised for the entire year, including the additional session in October, and this is important taking into account the limited amount of time we have before Lima. We would like to bring to your attention that we clearly made that call to you in the March 2014 session of the ADP. The reflection note, specifically the \\'landscape of issues identified by Parties\\' is a fair attempt to reflect the views expressed by Parties1 however it has some short comings, such as: On how it reflects ideas communicated by Parties which in some instances are not a reflection of the ideas in their entirety as presented by Parties. Furthermore it doesn\\'t have the benefit of all submissions made by Parties specifically on what they see as elements of 2015 Agreement which may have come through after the publication of the reflection note. It conflates the two processes under the ADP, namely, arriving at elements of the negotiation text1 and information Parties will put forward when putting forward their contributions, It contains some elements that are not in conformity with the principles and provisions of the Convention, which is the overarching legal framework under which we are negotiating. On working towards information Parties will provide when communicating their intended nationally determined contributions, the African Group would like to share the following observations, We are concerned about the time available for Parties to meet the March 2015 deadline, given that the decision on information to be provided by Parties will only be adopted in Lima. We however see an opportunity for 2 the outcome of this session to be a draft conclusion that can provide guidance to Parties on how to proceed with the national processes b. We note the oversight by the Co-chairs in consistently referring to nationally determined contributions in the scenario note1 whereas the precise language from Warsaw is of intended nationally determined contributions\\', and wish to put it on record that such an oversight severely prejudices the African Group position that such contributions are subject to a multilateral assessment for fairness and adequacy. The African Group further wish to express concern over scope, and focus of the work undertaken by some organisations in the context of paragraph 2d of decision 1/CP.19. Our experience in Africa is that the regional workshop by UNDP focussed on mitigation, and did not address the core basis of the mandate, which is provision of financial; support. Our understanding as the African Group is that, the scope of this work also includes adaptation, finance, and technology contributions. We are of the view that further guidance is necessary for such important initiatives, to avoid prejudice to positions of other Parties. Understanding that contributions from developed countries should also include provision of finance and technology transfer and capacity building by developed countries to developing countries, sequencing is of utmost importance, where there is early clarity on means of implementation to be provided by developed countries as this is key information for developing countries to communicate meaningful intended national determined contributions. It is also important to reach an early agreement on the process of communication of the contributions. Lastly Co-chairs, we understand that the stock-taking meeting referred to in para 28 of the scenario note will include the work undertaken under Workstream I of 3 the ADP, and we see the stock-taking meeting as a critical stage in this session to start working on the conclusions of this session. With regards to Workstream II, the Group welcomes your suggestion for a COP decision in Lima and sees it as an opportunity to further strengthen our work, its modalities, arrangements and process, through the following: a. Broaden the scope of activities beyond TEMs as reflected in para 4 of Decision 1/CP.19 as to include concrete proposals such as (i) the transformation of the CDM Pipeline into net mitigation projects or (ii) the expansion of national REFiTs schemes, Ensure this week KP and ADP ministerial roundtables outcomes and recommendations on Pre-2020 Ambition are followed-up accordingly under the Workstream, Assess the extent and effectiveness of the accelerated implementation of decisions constituting the agreed outcome under the Bali Action Plan, in particular in relation to the provisions of means of implementation as per para 3 of Decision 1/CP.19, for appropriate further actions 10. Furthermore, after a careful review of the rich content of the technical paper on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency; we are convinced of the necessity to go a step beyond technical examinations and elaboration of policy briefs, to the matching of the technical outputs with adequate support and support channels, for effective implementation. Co-chairs, The African Group stands ready to engage in the session in an open and constructive manner and to move the ADP towards achieving its mandate for this year, which is to reach an agreement on the elements of a negotiation text for the 2015 agreement. I thank you\"'],\n",
              "       ['72,2,5,5,20140604,ailac,\"Thank you Co-Chairs. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the AILAC group of countries. At the outset, l would like to associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chairs. Allow me to express AILAC\\'s appreciation for your considerable effort in the preparation of the Landscape of Issues identified by Parties, which contains a comprehensive recollection of the multiple elements that have been discussed under the ADP\\'s deliberations up until today. This Landscape will help us as a useful tool to move forward in the deliberations of the ADP Contact Group. It meets the three fundamental principles we have agreed: a partydriven process, based upon the inputs of Parties, and with outputs that reflect such inputs. This is the type of work that we expect from you and we consider it to be an adequate starting point for our deliberations. We most assuredly reiterate our support to your guidance under this approach, and look forward to progressive outcomes from our deliberations that capture, as you have done so far, the will and inputs from the Parties. AILAC acknowledges the fact that, given that the Landscape recalls all of the issues and elements brought forward by the Parties under the ADP\\'s deliberations, it presents divergent views on a number of topics. Others, clearly present groundwork for building consensus in hopes of arriving at common grounds and concepts that enable the result of a draft text at the next COP in Lima. Yet, we must highlight that in this exercise there is still an imbalance in the way some issues are presented, since some points provide for a clear narrative to enable their understanding, whereas others are presented on a short schematic approach that seems somewhat disorganized and disarticulated with regards to other elements presented. This of course is part the work that the Parties must engage in in the next days. Co-Chairs, AILAC is unequivocally committed to engage in a constructive discussion with all Parties and stakeholders under the ADP on this basis, without prejudice to the final outcome and its legal form, so as to achieve significant progress in this session and ensure that we arrive at a coherent draft text to be adopted in Lima that in turn enables the adoption of an agreement in Paris on 2015. Co-Chairs, As the Lima COP approaches, we are conscious of the urgent need to intensify our work. Back in March, as we closed our previous meeting, AILAC identified two main challenges for the way ahead: First, engaging in a contact group setting requires that Parties have a strong sense of trust and ownership over what we are working on, and at the same time that we are able to deliver through an efficient and rationalized mode of work, under the able guidance of the Co-Chairs. Second, we still need to identify the elements that will allow us to gather momentum under work-stream 2, going from the initial technical phase, towards a political one where we can have a significant impact on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation actions. As we start these two intense weeks, we have the expectation that we will face these challenges and progress decisively towards COP 20. For this, Co-Chairs, we consider it is fundamental that at this session, we continue engaging constructively on further exploring all the elements that the future legally binding agreement must include. AILAC reiterates the need for those elements to highlight our common global goals and objectives that define a long term vision on each of the main elements of the agreement, as well as the general guiding provisions that will serve as a basis for the future agreement. The 2015 agreement must also set forth clearly the way by which each country will contribute to achieve those global goals. ln this regard we have coined in Warsaw the concept of the iNDCs. In April, UNDP and the Government of Colombia held the First Technical Dialogue on iNDCS in Bogota, with the objective of discussing amongst Latin-American countries the scope and the challenges in preparing this contributions. Discussion were indeed productive in particular in regards to the underlying technical basis required to prepare robust, realistic and achievable contributions; as well in the identification of support needs required to reach domestic agreement and follow-up actions in this regard. With this broad conceptual structure in mind, where for each element we craft a global goal accompanied by what all Parties will do to contribute towards its achievement, AILAC looks forward to further developing the elements of the 2015 agreement. AILAC stands AILAC ready to work with all parties, and under the able guidance of our distinguished Co-Chairs, to further develop our collective clarity of the concepts that appear in the Landscape. We are confident that working together will bring us to a renewed global response to climate change. Our collective aim is to achieve a workabfe and coherent draft negotiating text by the end of this year. For this purpose it is imperative that Parties work together to promptly define the elements of the agreement, In parallel, as mandated by COP 19, it is crucial to focus in the preparation of the Lima decision on the information that should accompany NDC, in order to facilitate the understanding and comparability of Parties\\' contributions. These two should be our priorities here in Bonn. Finally, we would like to highlight the crucial importance that workstream 2 has for AlLAC. We know that additional efforts are needed this decade, if we are to achieve our common objective of avoiding temperature rise above 22c. Efforts and actions undertaken today will be significant savings for the future- this must be always kept in mind. Workstream 2 must contribute to the implementation more ambitious actions in the immediate future and to catalyze a significant increase in investment in climate change in the years between now and 2020. There is an important link between the pre 2020 definition of mitigation ambition, and the clarity and predictability in the pathway to increase the provision of financial resources between now and 2020. This link must not be overseen. In this context, the urgent and significant capitalization of the GCF plays a pivotal role. We were very encouraged by the results of the last GCF Board meeting in Songdo, and are looking forward to see the fund capitalized in the next months, with a very substantial initial capitalization amount; we expect the Fund to be ready to start disbursing resources by the Lima COP. Along with this effort, we must find specific ways in which workstream 2 can contribute to deliver ambitious results on the ground. The technical phase of our work has been useful and necessary; yet, it is time to clearly link this work with political decision-making and concrete mitigation action. We must bear in mind that the potential success of the mitigation component under workstream 1, will build upon the foundations of our pre2020 work. These foundations need to be strong, robust, well designed and appropriately built, so that the architecture of the future agreement can be ambitious, visionary, and built for delivering long term results. Co-Chairs, what fies ahead of us is no easy task. We stand ready to work together with all Parties, under your able guidance, to achieve ambitious results. We fully trust you to guide us through this journey, for which you have all our support, and can count on us for moving ahead decisively and boldly. This however cannot be achieved without the commitment of all of us to work together. This is why, through you Co-Chairs, AILAC also would like to express that we fully trust all of our negotiating partners, we count on al! of them, and we will be reinforcing our efforts to reach out to all of them, in order to move forward together towards the results that we all need to achieve during the next weeks and months. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['73,2,5,5,20140604,alba,\"Mr. President. Climate Change negotiations. they are at a critical point. Since the approval of the Durban Platform in 2011, intensified attacks on the principles and provisions of the Convention. It is intended to generate new arrangements that delete the differences in terms of different country responsibilities developed and developing, and therefore of the commitment that the former have in terms of mitigation, adaptation and compensation for loss and damage; along with financing, technology transfer and capacity building. These commitments were accepted by signing the Convention in 1992 and ratify its principles in Rio in 2012. At the same time The aim is to promote market mechanisms, whose operability, effectiveness and ethical bases are strongly questioned, as a way out of the permanence of the effects of economic and financial crisis and maintaining the hegemony of the currently dominant groups, by legitimizing the law to pollute for those who can pay it and the commodification of the nature and human beings. We can allow this to happen and there is no time to waste. We all live on the same planet, we are part of it ecosystem and we are threatened by imbalances that our same species has generated. All human beings are threatened by the climate catastrophe that is just beginning, but not all in the same way. Nor are our responsibilities the same. The truth is clear and simple: Developed countries have generated this crisis but developing countries and their populations are poor and vulnerable, those who suffer it most intensely and they are at greater risk. This simple truth, integrated into the principles of the Convention, it cannot be ignored. As if that were not enough, ironically, it is the developing countries that have brought more emission reductions to date emissions There is no solution without justice. It is worrying and sadly diagnostic that the Green Fund of the Climate has not already received significant contributions from the countries developed. The same secretary of the United Nations described it in Warsaw as an \"\"empty shell\"\". It has even been reached end of proposing that it be managed by the private sector, through from private banking. Mr. President. Given the urgency of the crisis we want to establish some lines bases of what must be that agreement that we hope with all our strength to achieve in 2015. It is worrying that the legal regime established by the Convention and his Kyoto Pro Tocolo seems to be blurring and blurring in ADP discussions , which could create a legal vacuum regarding the legal guarantees that the community has for the implementation of the Convention. Thus , Any future agreement must continue with what has been achieved until now and strengthen it. We need our legal experts work on this subject as one of the central themes of discussion. The Principles of the Convention they must be respected, we need clear rules to ensure that this is the case, not ambiguous statements with multiple interpretations. These principles establish a differentiation of countries by their historical responsibilities, this it must be clearly reflected in the provisions of the agreement. All commitments must be measured, reported and verified, including the commitments of developed countries in the provision of financing, technology and construction of capacities. Adaptation and mitigation are equally important and should be represented in equal measure. It is the peoples, represented by their governments, who have the duty and responsibility to mediate and balance the interests of different actors who make life within your countries. It is neither possible nor acceptable to delegate State responsibilities to the private sector. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a country-led climate con ference, not a round of business focused exclusively on new mechanisms of market or a lobby for private companies. Mr president Time is short, we spend hours, days, weeks turning around euphemisms and conventions without attacking the issues crucial. Peoples suffer and tire, mother earth does not wait. We are nearing the end of a negotiation cycle, fears and hopes intensify but a question haunts us: The Protocol Kyoto has had huge failures stemming from inaction and default of developed countries. The second period of Kyoto commitment, with its notable shortcomings and not yet ratified by enough countries for it to enter into force barely represents the 15% of global emissions. No instrument can succeed before such a lack of commitments, what will be different now? We know what is at stake, Mr. President. ALBA once manifests more to you and to the world, our unwavering commitment to the climatic health of the planet. We are ready to put body and soul into this task, but we are equally committed to our principles, our political processes and our history, to fight tirelessly for the sovereignty, equity, justice and well-being for all peoples. Forgetting the past is making yourself complicit in the injustices of the present. There is not nor can there ever be a solution without justice. THANKS A LOT \"'],\n",

We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China as well as Nepal on behalf of the LDCs and Sudan on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for your continued hard work and assure you of our full trust and confidence in your leadership as we move forward in this crucial process. The recent contributions of the IPCC Working Groups 2 and 3 to the Fifth Assessment Report underscore that Small Island Developing States are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events. Given the urgency of the task at hand, we hope to avoid squandering precious time haggling over procedural issues here and feel strongly that a single contact group is the most effective way for us to proceed. Co-Chairs, Regarding pre-2020 mitigation ambition, we recognize the need for political discussion on paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. It is incumbent on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change by raising the ambition of their 2020 commitments, and with regard to KP parties, ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. In addition, we must fully implement the Bali Action Plan, particularly through immediate action by developed countries to enhance the delivery of finance, technology transfer and development, and capacity building. AOSIS is of the view that the technical expert meetings under Workstream 2 can be a means to achieving these objectives. The discussions during the technical expert meetings under Workstream 2 in March, where parties shared their success stories deploying renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, demonstrated that the solutions to climate change are well within reach. We welcome the updated Technical Paper on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, which we found to be very comprehensive and useful and we look forward to additional TEMs, including a second meeting this year on renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as on other policy areas with high mitigation potential and important cobenefits. Our challenge must be continually moving these technical discussions toward ways we can work together to mobilize solutions. We look forward to the Technical Expert Meetings on land use and cities during this session, and we hope to have another meeting on renewable energy and energy efficiency. We also hope intensify our support for the Workstream 2 process, and we encourage more developed countries to come forward with their plans to enhance short-term ambition. We also welcome the engagement by ministers at this meeting and hope that the new focus on proven climate solutions under this process helps pave the way to increased ambition and ultimately closing the emissions gap. Co-Chairs, We were also able to deepen our discussions about the 2015 agreement under Workstream 1 in March. In light of the latest science about sea level rise and other worsening climate impacts, the level of ambition is absolutely critical to our group. Our response must therefore be driven by a real sense of urgency. With this in mind we would like to see this session focus on the following areas: First, A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the final 2015 agreement; and Second, Identification of the information needed to allow parties to present their intended nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates clarity, transparency, and an understanding. Additionally, finance is an integral building block of the 2015 agreement. The 2015 agreement MUST contain commitments by developed country Parties and provisions to ensure scaled-up, adequate long term, predictable, new and additional finance to support mitigation and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries. This should complement other necessary means of implementation including transfer of technology and capacity building. AOSIS expects the new agreement to address the gaps of the current climate finance architecture and flows, including the shortage of funding for concrete adaptation in most vulnerable countries and the barriers to access resources for those capacity-constrained countries. Both public and private flows towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development have to be scaled up urgently and different types of financing should be used and prioritized for different activities. Developed countries will have the same obligations to provide support under the new agreement as they have under the Convention and they should take the lead in scaling-up climate finance. Also, as mandated by the decision 1/CP17, the outcome of the 2013-2015 Review should inform ambition under the new agreement, thus we would like to see the Chairs of the Structured Expert Dialogue regularly report to the ADP on progress being made. Co-Chairs, Loss and damage due to the impacts of climate change is a reality for AOSIS and it must therefore be part of the 2015 agreement. Loss and Damage must be a separate element under the new agreement. The establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism to address Loss and Damage represents an important step and while our work there continues, it must also be anchored in the new agreement. There is much work to accomplish in a very short period of time, but we are optimistic that if we work with a shared sense of purpose and urgency we can make substantial progress on these priority areas in both Workstreams, and fulfill the mandate we have from the COP. As always, we assure you of our support as we continue to make progress in this critical area. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['75,2,5,5,20140604,basic,\"Co-Chairs. I have the honour to speak on behalf of BASIC. We wish to associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. First of all, we would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of the Co-Chairs in facilitating the ADP negotiation process thus far and in particular for your reflections note on the discussions during the March ADP session, which we think helps to give Parties a useful information and good overview of the landscape of issues. We assure you of our continued support and cooperation in the ADP negotiations this year. We have already done a lot of work in the ADP and Parties\\' have a much clearer picture of each others\\' expectations and interests. The time left for us to finalise the 2015 agreement and achieve a concrete and meaningful outcome on pre-2020 ambition is, however, very limited. We are therefore pleased to start this session in a contact group setting to work through the balanced, focused and formal mode of negotiation. Co-Chairs. It is important at the outset to remind ourselves that the Durban Platform is to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. This means that the 2015 agreement must strengthen the multilateral rules-based system under the Convention. To achieve this, the outcome of our work under both Workstreams must be science-based, ambitious and equitable. It ls by no means to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or reinterpret the Convention or its principles, provisions and Annexes. The ADP Warsaw Decision further reiterates that the Durban Platform is under the Convention and shall be guided by the principles of the Convention, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. This was also clear in our decisions from Durban and Doha. The 2015 agreement must therefore adhere to the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Articles 4 and 12, which reflect the common but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries. Decision 1/CP.19 has given us a clear set of tasks for 2014: We need to further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text, and identify by Lima, the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their intended nationally determined contributions. The 2015 agreement should address all elements referred to in paragraph 5 of Decision 1 /CP .17, i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building and transparency of action and support, in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and should not just be confined to mitigation. ln accordance with the Durban mandate, we further mapped out our work in Warsaw and decided that Parties\\' intended nationally determined contributions must cover mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed country Parties to developing countries. The Warsaw ADP decision also invited all Parties to initiate and intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions. However, with regard to the intended nationally determined contributions, it is important to understand that contributions should cover all the pillars of the Convention and be in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular the Article 4 of the Convention. We call on developed countries in particular to include in their submissions of contributions and information on the provision of finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries in addition to their mitigation commitments. Developing country Parties\\' contributions will be in the context of sustainable development, and dependent on the financial and technological support provided by developed country Parties. We also believe that information to facilitate the understanding and transparency of the contributions shall be differentiated between developed and developing countries. Co-Chairs. With regard to pre-2020 ambition, we must address mitigation, adaptation and finance and technology support. We urge developed country Parties participating in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to revisit and significantly increase their emission reduction targets in 2014. We also urge developed countries that are not part of the second commitment period to also significantly raise the ambition of their commitments under the Convention within the same timeframe and in a comparable manner. We also urge those Annex I Parties that have not put forward a 2020 pledge to do so. Developed countries should also honour and fulfill their commitments on the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries during the preM2020 period. And we look forward to the Ministerial Roundtabte and Dialogue on these issues above. We will continue our engagements and participations in the Technical Expert Meetings. However, Workstream II should not be downgraded to the TEMs on few selective sectors. It is fundamental for Workstream II to focus on dealing with crucial issues related to revisiting and increasing the comparable emission reduction targets by all developed country Parties under the second commitment period of the KP or under the Convention and enhancing provision of finance, technology and capacity building by developed country Parties to developing country Parties. Paragraph 3 and 4 of decision 1/CP.19 are an integral and essential part of the work under Workstream II. These two paragraphs should be seriously discussed under the Contact Group as a matter of urgency, with a view to achieving a balanced and comprehensive outcome on implementing the workplan of pre-2020 ambition in Lima. We are concerned that the mitigation effort by developing country Parties is currently much greater than that by developed countries. As developing countries we are ready to undertake our enhanced action to address climate change. Our concern however is that developed countries have not shown sufficient ambition, despite their historical responsibility and greater access to the means of implementation. It is simply not acceptable that the commitments of developed countries should be transferred to developing countries. We nevertheless commend the wide array of climate initiatives that are pursued outside the Convention and we recognize that these international cooperative initiatives may help us to combat climate change. These initiatives must however be treated in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention and must not distract us here in our efforts to address the challenge of climate change multilaterally under the Convention. However, 2 of these initiatives can\\'t substitute for the core actions required under the Kyoto Protocol and its revisit. We would like to reiterate our full commitment and support to you in facilitating the ADP process forward, with a view to making balanced and comprehensive progress in an open and transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-building manner. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs. \"'],\n",
              "       ['76,2,5,5,20140604,crn,\"Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We believe the 2015 agreement should be based on the elaboration of all 6 core elements identified in decision 1/CP.17: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building. On mitigation, the new agreement should tal(e into account the latest scientific information with the global commitment to be set at a level that would maintain global temperature in accordance with a 1,5 C degree global goal. While the agreement should be applicable to all, the principles of the Convention should be respected and leadership from developed countries guide us in the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. The nature of nationally determined contributions to be presented by all Parties should be differentiated. The 2015 agreement should be adequately informed by the work of other subsidiary bodies under the Convention and build upon important results achieved through past COP decisions. On mitigation, the new agreement should tl1erefore include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by a broad variety of financing sources, primarily from developed country Parties. The Warsaw REDD+ Framework should serve as the foundation of such a mechanism. Mr Co-Chair, we are looking forward to engaging with all Parties during the Technical Expert Meetings this session, in particular on REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems. As identified by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the mitigation gap is greater than before and there is a clear need to increase mitigation ambition. Tropical deforestation and forest degradation represent the largest and most variable single contributor\\' to emissions from land-use change and this is why mitigation actions on REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems are within reach and can contribute significantly toward reducing that gap. Mr Co-Chair, we see four main objectives to be achieved in Lima under the ADP; The inclusion of REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems into a COP decision draft negotiating text, based on the supporting decisions of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework Capturing the results of the technical expert meetings in a COP decision so that concrete mitigation actions are identified to close tl1e ambition gap before 2020; Successfully launching the Warsaw REDD+ Framework as per decision 10/CP.19; The opening of a REDD+ window in the GCF Finally Mr Co-Chairs, We are looking forward to engaging with all Parties in the elaboration of the elements of the draft negotiating text to be delivered in Lima. We are confident that you will assist us in the completion of this challenging task.\"'],\n",
              "       ['77,2,5,5,20140604,eig,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, we all have heard the very clear message from the IPCC. Climate Change is a fundamental threat to humankind. But this threat can be prevented. The newest reports of the IPCC have also shown that we do have the scientific knowledge, the technological possibilities and the economic means to keep global temperature increase below 2?C. What is needed is to operationalize the political will which our ministers have expressed repeatedly. And this is why we are here, to work together to ensure that the ministers will have a sound basis for taking the needed decisions in Lima. Mr. Co-Chairs, ADP is entering its final stage: by 2015 we must adopt a legally binding instrument effective from 2020 onwards that must be a comprehensive response to the urgent challenge of climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and building on transparency. To this aim, the ADP - under its workstream 1 - must develop by the end of 2014 a clean draft negotiation text. The EIG agrees that the draft negotiation text should be construed collectively and be build upon the views expressed by Parties in submissions and in statements and in the negotiations. The best way to reflect all views is that you, Mr. Co-Chair, will prepare the draft text for negotiations. The EIG calls for a legally binding instrument with all Parties taking appropriate mitigation commitments which include clearly defined targets or actions, under the same rules but at different depths in terms of type of commitment, timing, and level of effort according to CBDR/RC and equity. In this regard, the ADP must adopt by COP20 in Lima the information that Parties are to submit along their intended nationally determined contributions well before COP21, in the first quarter of 2015 for those ready to do so. We must leave Bonn with a draft decision on this issue and allow sufficient time here in Bonn to deliver on this specific mandate from Warsaw. The instrument must also equally address adaptation: Adaptation is a fundamental challenge for all of us. We need a strong and effective framework that helps all countries, and especially the most vulnerable in need of support, to develop and implement effective adaptation policies. Support will similarly be important. The EIG welcomes the successful meeting of the Green Climate Fund Executive Board in Sondgo in Korea. An important step has been achieved, we have now to move rapidly to the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. [We are optimistic that at the first GCF meeting for the initial capitalization will successfully take place in a month time in the Swiss capital of Bern and that it will allow this new international finance instrument to be very soon fully operational. And we hope that the UN Climate Summit will be another important stepping stone towards the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. Mr. Co-Chair. We have another very urgent matter to deal with: the pre-2020 ambition. In our view all parties should contribute to close the emissions gap in view of achieving the target to keep global warming below 2 degrees with respect to historic levels. Therefore, there is a need to for increased action within and outside the Convention. Here in Bonn we must further explore through the technical Expert Meetings opportunities for climate action. This technical work must build towards the high-level events later this year. By Lima we will have to capture progress in increased action and lay a solid foundation for further work. Finally, Mr Co-Chairs, the EIG appreciates your arrangements for efficient and focused work under the ADP. The Scenario note, the Reflection on the progress made and the Landscape of issues identified by Parties are outlining a positive, constructive and solution-oriented a\"'],\n",
              "       ['78,2,5,5,20140604,eu,\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gives us hope - if we act collectively, urgently and at the global level we can achieve the below 2?C objective - and do so in a manner that promotes sustainable economic growth, as well as wider benefits such as improvement of health, air quality, water quality and energy security. This is what the ADP will be measured against. Decision 1/CP19 invited Parties to come forward with their national contributions well in advance of Paris and in the first quarter of 2015 for those Parties in a position to do so. It is essential that all Parties stick to the timetable that was agreed in Warsaw. We expect all major and emerging economies, as well as other Parties that are ready, to also come forward in early 2015. The EU will do so. Achieving the below 2?C objective will require deeper cuts in emissions from all Parties, with the major and emerging economies leading the way. We welcome the initiative of the Secretariat to facilitate the coordination of the support and capacity building that is available to Parties that need it to develop contributions, building on the workshop and briefing in the March session. Across the EU we are mobilising support and technical assistance through a number of bilateral and multilateral programmes and projects, and we are also encouraging and further supporting international organisations to do likewise. Decision 1/CP19 also specified that the upfront information requirements in relation to contributions must be agreed by COP20 at the latest. Drafting a decision on upfront information should be a focus of this session. The last months have seen a wealth of ideas that Parties have put forward on the draft elements of the 2015 Agreement. These have been captured in the co-Chairs\\' reflection note of the March session. We now need to have more detailed discussions on all the issues raised by Parties in order identify potential areas of convergence; to crystallise distinct options; and to set out areas of further work needed to move towards a succinct draft elements text by Lima. It is the duty of the co-Chairs to facilitate this Party driven process. In the March technical meeting on opportunities for action on renewable energy and energy efficiency, many shared best practice and ideas for further mitigation actions in line with economic and social priorities. Parties indicated tangible ways to raise ambition by 2020. We want to deepen this exchange and to look into further opportunities for action by 2020 through addressing urban challenges and land use. This discussion should be focused on enabling Parties and institutions to join up efforts towards scaling up action in areas of high mitigation potential, and to provide guidance to that effect. This technical work must feed concrete ideas into political processes. We need to identify the most efficient way to do so, for instance drawing a summary for policymakers out of the list of policy options identified in the technical process for Ministers to consider, and to engage Convention bodies and international organisations to facilitate action and implementation on the ground. Political leadership is essential to make progress in 2014, a year in which the UN Secretary-General will convene World Leaders to discuss climate change for the first time since 2009. We need highlevel guidance on progress towards the 2015 Agreement, as well as the policy packages and international initiatives that will unlock new opportunities for low-emission climate-resilient development before 2020. Some of this high-level guidance and leadership must result from the ministerial meetings we are convening tomorrow and the day after. This guidance and the work of the ADP should provide the context for the UN Secretary-General summit. The EU will this week show that we are implementing our pre-2020 commitments effect\"'],\n",
              "       ['79,2,5,5,20140604,g77china,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC has confirmed that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. As we begin the June session in a contact group setting, we are mindful of the little time remaining for Parties to complete our work. The Group believes that the work of this session needs to be formal, focused and proceed with a sense of utmost urgency. The Group of 77 and China would like to thank the co-chairs for their efforts in providing their reflection note and the annex which are very helpful to further the understand ing of the various views of Parties during the past sessions in order to further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text by COP 20 in Lima, as agreed in Doha and Warsaw. The Group has also, from the very beginning stressed that the work under the Contact Group on implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 and must reflect balanced progress, namely between both work streams and in both workstreams We trust that y ou as our co-chairs will facilitate our work based on the decisions 1/CP.17 . 2/CP.18 and 1/CP.19 towards elements for a draft negotiating text based on inputs and submissions by parties; and toward enhanced ambition pre 20 20 in accordance with the Durban mandate. In this regard, the Group is of the view that: The work under the Ad hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilitprinciples of equity and common but differentiated responsibilitiesies and and respective capabilities;respective capabilities; The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent;must be fully inclusive and transparent; The ADPThe ADP process will build on inputs from Partiesprocess will build on inputs from Parties.

The Group also looks forward to advance negotiations on the scope and nature of the intended nationally determined contributions. In doing so, the Group would like to reiterate that decision 1/CP.19 paragraph 2(d) urges developed countries, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other organizations to provide support to allow for developing countries to undertake our domestic preparations for the intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon. We welcome the full operationalization of the Green Climate Fund and urgently call for the immediate capitalization of The Convention\\'s financial mechanism, with new, additional, adequate, sustained, accessible, and predictable funding. The Group of 77 and China wants to be clear that Work stream II is an integral part of the ADP. In this regard, the Group welcomes the opening of the Technical Expert Meetings (TEMs) in March under the Work plan on Enhancing Mitigation Ambition mandated in paragraph 7 of the Durban decision. We note, however, that the TEMs only address the issues canvassed in paragraph 5(a) and (b) of Decision 1/CP.19. For this reason, the issue of the lack of Annex I ambition in the pre-2020 period, including KP commitments and the compliance with them, must also be part of the discussion. We have all agreed on the importance and the necessity for Annex I Parties to take the lead in addressing climate change. This requires that they raise their level of mitigation ambition, in particular through the obligation this year to revisit the level of ambition of QELROs under the Kyoto 3 Protocol??s Second Commitment Period, and through comparable efforts under the Convention by those Annex I Parties not participating in the Second Commitment Period. In this regard, we welcome the opportunity to address these issues at Ministerial level over coming days, and call for the ADP contact group that we launched in March to allocate time here in Bonn to further our work on paragraphs 3 and 4 of Decision 1/CP.19.

I would like to align my statement with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, and by Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. At the outset allow me to thank you for your continued efforts and commitment to leading this process forward, as demonstrated by your reflection and scenario notes. The LDC Group has every confidence in your leadership and we are prepared to maintain our high level of engagement in this process. Co-Chairs, the LDC Group believes that a successful outcome in 2015 is possible. In this critical stage of negotiations it is important for all Parties to redouble their efforts for ambition and constructive engagement. We are encouraged by the efforts countries have taken to raise climate change in their governments\\x19 agenda. In this regard, we welcome the most recent announcement from the USA to reduce emissions from existing power plants. The LDC Group views this action as really constructive first step. This proposal, whilst very useful, does not yet lead the USA on a pathway towards achieving their goal of reducing emissions 80% by 2050 nor on a 2?C pathway leading towards the 1.5 degree target as called for by the LDCs, SIDS and Africa. We look forward to further developments in US policies as we progress toward the adoption of the 2015 agreement. Co-Chairs, the LDC Group sees no substantial problem with the way you have proposed to proceed during this session. The order of discussions starting with adaptation in the first week and technology development and transfer in the second week is acceptable to our Group, as long as adequate time is given to each element. Co-Chairs, for LDCs, the 2015 agreement should embrace all of the elements reflected in decision 1/CP17, even if there are institutions already established by COP decisions. The agreement also needs to be underpinned by the latest science, and the sense of high urgency arising from the findings of the IPCC fifth assessment report. Co-Chairs, we welcome your reflections note, and the annex on \\x1clandscape of issues\\x1d is a useful way forward. However, we will need to develop a process where we can consolidate the options into a more manageable list, narrowing down the options toward a workable agreement in 2015. We will be providing our views on what we think are the preferable options within this landscape, including: how we see an agreement that is applicable to all and legally binding as wanted by the LDCs; and how to accommodate a clear reference to the specific circumstances of the LDCs, as spelt out in Article 4.9 of the Convention. For LDCs, the key elements for the new agreement include: the need for a legally binding agreement that delivers strong mitigation ambition with short time periods no longer than five years; the inclusion of the Loss and Damage Mechanism in the new agreement; a compliance mechanism for cases where Parties do not meet their obligations; a review process to assess the adequacy of the aggregate proposals to ensure that they are consistent with emission pathways to limit global average temperature increases to below 1.5??C above pre-industrial levels over the long-term; and adequate and predictable finance, technical support and capacity building for both adaptation and mitigation. Furthermore, LDCs want to see how a legally binding agreement applicable to all, can accommodate a clear reference to the specific circumstance of the LDCs, as per article 4.9 of the Convention. Co-Chairs, our Group believes that Parties need to have a discussion about the legal form of the 2015 agreement. While we acknowledge that there are sensitivities with this discussion, we need to ensure that the text we develop is consistent with the legal form of the outcome. The legal form will no doubt be a political decision and so we need \"'],\n",

IPCC stress that the elevation of level of sea ??and extreme meteorological phenomena and with the warming by almost a degree, we are experiencing more storms frequent and intense, more droughts and the reappearance of old diseases. We emphasize that it is not only after impacts of special phenomena (\"\"shocks\"\"), the named hurricane amemolos, but also the accumulation of smaller scale events already cause us a need to adaptation (\"\"stress\"\"), due to the persistent severity of its accumulated effects. Given the urgency of the area ahead, we propose to avoid wasting precious time on procedural matters and We propose that a unique contact group be created as the most effective to tackle our task. This emphasis on impacts, in their most dire aspects, and in need to avoid them through collective action and cooperation must be our guide. This is not another point to which the objective of the Convention points us. A single contact group can be the most effective way to address our area, considering the limited composition of the delegations of many developing countries and start our negotiations for a formal and structured way where there is the required balance between WS1 and WS2, to reach balance and ambition in all the elements in the future. Regarding the pre-2020 mitigation ambition, we call urgent to all Parties and especially to developed countries to assume leadership in the fight against climate change by increasing ambition to pre-2020 commitments, establishing concrete actions in addressing the existing ambition gap pre-2020 and especially, as allocate financial support, capacity building and access to technology to promote such actions in our countries. We also reiterate our commitment to work together with All Parties, by a binding agreement in 2015, in accordance with the principles of the Convention, common responsibilities but differentiated and reach the goal of all at 1.5 ? C above 9. Expect to intensify support for the Workstrearn 2 process and encourage you to the most developed countries to present their plans to improve ambition short term. We also welcome the commitment of the ministers at this meeting and hope that the new approach will help bring the path to greater ambition and ultimately closing the gap the emissions. Senior Co-Chairs, Also we were able to deepen our discussions on the 2015 agreement under Workstream 1 last March. In light of the last Scientific discoveries on the rise of! level of! sea \\x0b\\x0band others that worsen the effects of! climate, the level of ambition is absolutely fundamental for our group. Therefore, our response should be driven by a true sense of urgency. Also, reiterate that the provision for developed countries of financing, training and access to technology are elements essentials of 2015 agreement. The 2015 agreement should contain commitments of developed country Parties and provisions to guarantee the largest scale, adequate in the long term, of financing, foreseeable, new and additional, in addition to resources for training and access to technology to support mitigation and adaptation to the effects adverse of! climate change in developing countries and encourage resilient, sustainable and low emission development in countries in process of developing. SICA hopes that the new agreement will repair the gaps in the architecture of financing the current climate and slow flows, including the lack of of financing for concrete adaptation in the most vulnerable countries and the barriers to accessing resources can be overcome in the new agreement. Senior Co-Chairs, For the countries that make up SICA, losses and damages is a reality due to the impacts of climate change, so it should be part of 2015 agreement. Loss and damage must be a separate item in the framework of the new agreement. A separate area of ??the negotiation must be formed. with its own entity and deserves specific discussion in a session by separated. The establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism to address loss and damage represents an important step and although our work it does not continue, but must also be anchored in the new agreement.

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Success in reaching the objective of this process must be premised on all Parties working together in good faith and in the spirit of international cooperation and mutual understanding. To have a successful outcome in both Lima and Paris, it must be balanced, comprehensive, universal, credible, legitimate, and acceptable to all, so that all will implement it. The outcome must be consistent with the Convention, enhancing its full, effective and sustained implementation, and should avoid re-writing or re-interpreting any of its provisions or principles. Above all, the principles of equity and CBDR must remain the bedrock of the 2015 agreed outcome. A formal and structured mode of VOrl{ can help us make progress towards the elements for a draft negotiating text in Lima and achieve a balanced and comprehensive agreed outcome in Paris. The LMDC looks forward to starting the formal and structural negotiation focusing on the six core elements as mandated in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17 immediately beginning at this June session here in Bonn, marked with a heightened sense of urgency. Negotiations must be Party-driven, open and transparent, inclusive, and based on consensus.

A formal mode of Vork means that Ve should use the formal textual documents based on and taken from inputs and submissions by Parties. We should be very cautious about rewriting or renegotiating the Convention under the name of \"\"new ideas\"\" reflected in the informal note. The focus of the Contact Group is to negotiate around the six core elements, i.e., mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, capacity building and transparency of action and support and relative enhanced action instead of debating philosophically around some \"\"new ideas\"\" deviating from the principles and provisions of the Convention. Co-Chairs. Many developing countries have individually been rapidly enhancing their own climate change actions at the domestic level, as appropriate to their national circumstances, using in large their part their own resources. For example, efforts on controlling coal consumption have been implemented in China. Nicaragua is rapidly implementing its renewable energy strategy. The Philippines is seeking to \"\"build back better\"\" as part of its climate change adaptation strategy in the face of more frequent and stronger typhoons such as Haiyan. India is rapidly upscaling its renewable energy use. Bolivia and Ecuador have seriously embarked on sustainable development pathways as outlined in their national constitutions. Kuwait launched the GlIGs Management Strategy in the petroleum sector. Venezuela, El Salvador, Egypt, Malaysia, Argentina) Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Pakistan, Sudan, Sri Lanka, DRC, Mali and other countries have also all put in place programmes and policies designed to ensure that climate change adaptation and mitigation co-benefits arise from their respective sustainable development plans. These are but a few examples of actions that many developing countries are tal{ing all over Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean1 the Pacific, to contribute their equitable share in addressing climate change even if they were the ones least historically responsible for having caused the problem. These actions cou1d all be enhanced if the Convention is fully and effectively implemented in a sustained manner consistent with equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. This must be our common goal because we share a common humanity and we all live on one planet-Mother Earth. Unfortunately, we have to register our deep disappointment that almost four years from the establishment of the Green Climate Fund at Cancun, it is yet to be fully operational, without any specific amount of \"\"very significant scale\\'\\' targeted for the initial resource mobilization process agreed recently in Songdo, coherent with the guidance provided by the COP in Warsaw to the GCF, as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention. Climate financing is not only a treaty commitment of developed countries under the Convention but is also the key, together with technology transfer, to unlocking building trust and higher mitigation and adaptation ambition in developing countries, as agreed by the COP in Warsaw on long-term finance. Equally disappointing, almost two years after Doha, is the fact that nearly no developed country Party has ratified the amendment to the Kyoto Protocol for its second commitment period. Almost equally disappointing is that at the same time, no developed country has put forward in the UNFCCC any concrete proposal, much less any commitment, to increase their pre-2020 mitigation ambition beyond those that they had already pledged at Cancun and that some developed country Parties even backtracl{ed on their emission reduction targets. In this regard, we reiterate that pre-2020 ambition covers mitigation, adaptation and finance and technology support to developing countries. We call for a clear roadmap for developed countries to fulfill their financial support in the period of 2014 to 2020 including the target of 70 billion USD by 2016 and addressing barriers to technology transfer including IPRs under ADP Workstream II. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of decision 1/CP.19 has preliminarily identified these key tasks which are integral and essential part of the work of the ADP, especially for Workstream II. These two paragraphs should be seriously negotiated among Parties under the Contact Group as a matter of urgency and priority. Arrangements and further concrete measures to implement these nvo paragraphs should be captured as the main results of Lima on pre2020 ambition. Co-Chairs, The daily suffering that the populations of our respective countries, as well as of other developing countries who are likewise least able to cope with extreme weather events and other adverse climate impacts, highlight the urgency of the need for all Parties to tal{e concrete steps and actions in the ADP process. Such concrete steps are needed in order to achieve an equitable outcome that will allo\\'v Parties to enhance their actions to achieve the full, effective, sustained and enhanced implementation of the Convention. To this end, the Ll1DC has submitted a draft text proposal entitled \"\"Elements for a Draft Negotiating Text of the 2015 ADP Agreed Outcome of the UNFCCC,\"\" to be circulated to all Parties as a conference room paper and as a basis for negotiation by the Parties in the ADP. Urgent action is needed. We wish to embark on Party-driven negotiations now. We owe this to all peoples of the \\'vorld, to Mother Earth, and present and future generations. The LMDC will continue to work with you, Co-Chairs, through our active, constructive, progressive, and positive engagement and involvement in these negotiations. Thank you very much, Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",
              "       ['83,2,5,5,20140604,umbrella,\"Co-Chairs, We have critical work to do here, on defining the elements for a draft negotiating text, advancing preparation of Parties\\x19 intended nationally determined contributions - specifically in identifying the information that Parties will put forward with their intended nationally determined contributions - and further exploring options to capture untapped mitigation potential. The Umbrella Group looks forward to working with all Parties to get down to business and bring further focus and clarity to these tasks. We also look forward to the opportunity our Ministers and their representatives will have to engage through the High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Friday. When Parties last met here in Bonn, we agreed we would continue the work of the ADP, under both its workstreams, through a single Contact Group: maintaining our current organisation of work, and working together to progress the substantive business of the ADP under your ongoing guidance. In relation to our work at this session, we look forward to having constructive exchanges informed by our discussions to date, and the numerous submissions in which Parties and Groups have elaborated their ideas -- in particular on the elements for a draft negotiating text. The discussions here in Bonn must provide the opportunity for Parties to better understand the range of proposals on the table, so that we can work toward identifying key issues and areas of convergence, that can serve as the basis for the contract group to begin to identify mutually accepted elements for a draft negotiating text. The Umbrella Group has the utmost confidence in the co-chairs\\x19 ability to guide us in this work. Co-Chairs, The 5th assessment report from the IPCC is now complete, and this demonstrates the urgency of our work. We are committed to finalizing the 2015 agreement in Paris, and expect countries intended nationally determined contributions to be submitted well in advance of this. We have a lot of work to do before then, however, In our work here and in Lima to define elements for a draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreement, we need to start constructing a clear overarching view of what our leaders will accept as an effective and lasting global platform for post-2020 climate action. Our work should continue to be guided by the below two-degree global goal. We need to think carefully about what elements must go in a core agreement \\x13 elements that remain sound in the context of changing circumstances and capture the highest level understandings and commitments, including a commitment by all Parties to make a contribution to the global task of reducing emissions. Provisions that don??t meet these criteria, provisions that are likely to require updating over time, which elaborate implementing arrangements, or provisions which may need to be developed further between 2015 and 2020, should be included in the wider 2015 package. And we also have to forge a common understanding around when and how draft text of the 2015 agreement appears, to satisfy both expectations of the Parties and ensure procedures are applied. Co-Chairs, We should also use this session to discuss the work we??re doing at home to prepare intended nationally determined contributions. It??s important that we all understand that each of us intends to act.

              "       ['84,2,6,6,20141020,aosis,\"Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China and Nepal on behalf of the LDCs. Co-Chairs, First, let me thank you for your diligence and leadership throughout this process. Your scenario note lays out a sensible way to continue our discussions this week and we assure you of our full cooperation in this the final stretch to Lima. As always our work must be informed by the best available science and we begin this meeting against the backdrop of startling news from the arctic. Ahead of the U.N. Climate Summit in New York last month, NASA reported that the Arctic Ocean is losing on average about 13 percent of its sea ice every decade; that is an area equivalent to about one-third the size of the United States since records have been kept. Similar reports about unsettling changes in the Antarctic also continue to come in. The arctic melting is, of course, only one of the many disturbing climate impacts that are striking every nation and region around the world with increasing frequency and intensity. But from the perspective of a group of low-lying island and coastal nations that are highly vulnerable to sea level rise these impacts command an urgent ca ll to action. Given the reality of the impacts we are already experiencing, adaptation is absolutely critical. Of course, there are impacts that we can no longer adapt to so Loss and Damage must be included as a central element of the 2015 agreement, one that is distinct and separate from adaptation. The Loss and Damage mechanism should have technical and financial functions to support vulnerable SIDS and LDCs in addressing the direct impacts of climate change with a governance body that includes representation of SIDS. We look forward to discussing this more fully. For us, adaptation it is about survival. Co-Chairs, With Lima just weeks away, it is essential that we make significant progress this week in our discussions on Workstream 1 of the ADP, including on the nature of iNDCS. More broadly we see the need for more clarity and details in the following areas: The 2015 agreement must be legally binding protocol under the Convention, applicable to all. Ambition should be in line with delivering a long term global goal of limiting temperature increases to below 1.5 and need to consider at this session ways to ensure this. Mitigation efforts captured in the 2015 agreement must be clearly quantifiable so that we are able to aggregate the efforts of all Parties. A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the 2015 agreement; The identification of the information needed to allow parties to present their intended nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates clarity, transparency, and allows us to consider in terms of the long-term goal. Finance is a fundamental building block of the 2015 agreement, and therefore it MUST contain commitments by developed country Parties and provisions to ensure scaled-up, adequate long term, predictable, new and additional finance to support mitigation and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries. This should complement other necessary means of implementation including transfer of technology and capacity building. The new agreement should also address the gaps of the current climate finance architecture and flows, including the shortage of funding for concrete adaptation in most vulnerable countries and the barriers to access resources for those capacity-constrained countries. Both public and private flows towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development have to be scaled-up urgently and different types of financing should be used and prioritized for different activities. But we know that addressing these threats we face adequately requires substantial emissions reductions in the near-term, well before 2020, and we think that Workstream 2 is our best opportunity to meet this imperative. We have seen very constructive and solutions-oriented discussions so far in areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as cities and land use.We look forward to the sessions on CCS and short lived climate pollutants this week. AOSIS has offered a number of proposals for how this technical work can be strengthened. We need to do more to engage parties and put good ideas to work. The UNFCCC and Convention provide an important platform for exchanges between policy experts and practitioners, as well as for strengthening initiatives in areas with high mitigation potential. However, providing technical information to parties is only the first step. Translating this progress into real action on the ground will require linking it to the ongoing political process and we see important opportunities where the COP can capture information from WS2 and give it higher visibility. For example, there should be high-level events at COPs, where countries are able to provide updates and discuss national and multilateral activities they are taking to enhance mitigation effort. The ADP Ministerial at Lima should be the first of these events and it will allow countries to inform the UNFCCC of action partnerships established, such as the ones announced at the very successful SIDS Conference in Samoa last month (although with the resources and partners required for scaling them up). There is also a need for political discussions on paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. It is incumbent on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change by raising the ambition of their 2020 commitments, and with regard to KP parties, ratifying the Doha Amendment to Kyoto Protocol. In addition, we must fully implement the agreed outcome of the Bali Action Plan, particularly through immediate action by developed countries to enhance the delivery of finance, technology transfer and development, and capacity building. You have done an extraordinary job bringing us so far along in this process and success is within reach. We assure you of our continued support as we work together to achieve our goals in Lima. Thank you. \"'],\n",
              "       ['85,2,6,6,20141020,ag,\"Co-chairs, Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. Allow me at the outset to express our appreciation to the Government of Germany for hosting this meeting, and for the Convention\\'s Secretariat for the excellent arrangements. The African Group associates its statement with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group 77 and China. Co-Chairs, on Workstream I, Our work is guided by the mandate we have from decision 1/CP.17, and we have made progress since Durban. The Doha decision and the Warsaw decision requires us to have elements of the draft negotiating text ready by Lima, as well as to identify the information Parties will provide when they communicate their INDCs. These are important milestones towards the Durban mandate. However, the African Group, is concerned by your presentation of these aspects of the same mandate separately. We are further concerned by the differing status of the two documents you provided, where INDCs are presented in the form of a draft text, whilst elements of the agreement are a non-paper. We raised concern during the last session of the ADP on this matter, and we believe a discussion on how we should capture these two aspects of our mandate should precede our discussion in this session. As Parties we should explore whether we need a single or two outcomes in Lima, and secondly whether these will be captured in the form of a decision or not. Co-Chairs our initial reflection on the substantive aspects of the two documents you presented to us, we appreciate and support your effort to focus us, and guide us to a negotiation mode of work, and we encourage you to continue doing so. Despite some shortcomings in the substance reflected in the non-paper on elements of the draft negotiating text, the paper does reflect the broad parameters of concern to the African Group. We would therefore be happy to engage with other Parties and groups to deepen our understanding of various concepts towards a successful outcome in Lima. On the INDC draft decision, it is important to have a discussion amongst Parties on how we can best deliver on the Warsaw undertaking on defining information that will be provided by Parties on their INDCs. The African Group view the draft text with concern, as it presents very precise expectations on mitigation, some optional language on adaptation, and no expectations on developed country Parties on finance, technology and capacity building, except for information presented in the Annex. We emphasise that our focus at this session should be on the information of INDC\\'s continual in the annex rather than the draft decision. The African Group reiterates its position that, the 2015 Agreement will not be a mitigation agreement; it should cover all commitment elements of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. We understand some Parties suggest that the INDCs were conceived with mitigation in mind; our understanding is that the INDCs will address all the elements. The African Group experience from Warsaw is that, the word \\'contributions\\' sought to address an impasse on the discussion of commitments and actions, rather than a reference to mitigation. We look forward to engaging with other Parties further, particularly on the adaptation INDC as this is a very important element for the African Group. We would like to state that most African countries are in a better position to develop their adaptation rather than mitigation INDCs. This is informed by our experience in developing NAPAs by LDCs, as well as the process of developing NAPs in developing countries. We see the adaptation INDC as presenting our planning efforts, our current and future adaptation needs and a voluntary recognition of our past investment, with a reciprocal communication of future support by developed countries. We further see developed countries presenting their means of implementation (technology, finance and capacity building) INDCs where they outline the extent, type, and activities to be supported on the basis of agreed MRV of support guidelines. Developed countries should further provide information on their support of INDC preparation as outlined in decision 1/CP .19, as we see this aspect in the context of Article 12 of the Convention. Co-Chairs, on Workstream II, The fundamental challenge on the pre 2020 ambition workstream is to turn the discussions we have had so far into concrete and implementable measures. Therefore providing a clearer sense of direction through the following: a. On Direction by Parties (via the COP} to the operating entities of the financial mechanism of the Convention. This could, for example, include recommendations in accordance with paragraph 4 of the GCF instrument which recognizes it functions \"\"under the guidance\"\" of the COP, and paragraph 6, which provides the GCF and COP will conclude arrangements relating to guidance on policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria. They could, for instance, recommend that the GCF provide immediate financial support for REDD+ readiness, the development of pilot projects to implement renewable energy projects in developing countries, including a range of measures such as feed-in tariffs. Also, on Direction by Parties to the broader institutions and mechanisms under the Convention - to cooperate to support integrated approaches to finance, technology and capacity building for the implementation of a global renewable energy partnership among Parties - to deliver as One UNFCCC.  Finally, on Direction to developed (Annex II) Parties to scale up finance specifically for initiatives identified under workstream II including through levels of financial support to the GCF and also clear benchmarks for support towards the $100 billion target referenced in relation to 2020. Among other things, links between the scale of mitigation ambition and the scale of financial support should be further identified and specified in the decision, building on Article 11.3{d) of the Convention which calls for analysis by the COP of the level of financing available and needed to implement the Convention. Co-chairs, The African Group stands ready to engage in this session as always, in an open and constructive manner to move the ADP towards achieving its mandate for this year, which is to reach an agreement on the elements of a negotiation text for the 2015 agreement.

At the outset, I would like to associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. I will begin by expressing AILAC\\'s appreciation for your effort and work in putting together two draft decision texts and a non-paper with a recollection of the multiple elements that have been discussed under the ADP\\'s deliberations. Chair, this is the kind of bold and effective work that we expect from you, while outcomes continue to be Party-driven, build on inputs from Parties, and reflect inputs from Parties. AILAC Members, as developing countries, are committed to engage in a constructive dialogue with all Parties and stakeholders under the ADP on this basis, continue to build bridges and genuinely reach out to others to find convergence areas, so as to achieve significant progress in this session and ensure that we agree to ambitious decisions on INDCs and WS2, and we adopt a substantive \"\"Lima draft\"\" as a result of COP20. Co-Chairs, We have only 18 days of negotiation before the closure of the Lima COP, and the sense of urgency increases for intensifying our work. We expect that this Bonn session will allow us to make significant progress. We welcome the suggestions you made in the scenario note, and will work to reach conclusions on the INDCs and WS2 decisions at this session. It is ambitious, but possible. AILAC has recently presented submissions that aim to promote further progress in our discussions. Some of the main ideas there contained deserve to be stressed here: FIRST. We have made a proposal on the overall architecture of the legally binding agreement, which provides for a durable, concise and ratifiable Paris Agreement, as well as for a system for country contributions, that captures legally binding individual commitments, while allowing for progressive scale-up of ambition over time without renegotiation or re-ratification. We have proposed specific elements for an iterative cycle of country contributions, fleshing out the steps of the cycle, and some of the modalities related to each step. We have stressed the importance of individual commitments under the new Agreement to foster ambitious domestic action to address the climate change challenge in all its dimensions. We have presented in detail the conceptual content of each of the elements to be included in the Paris Agreement, including adaptation, mitigation, means of implementation, loss and damage, transparency of action and support, compliance, legal clauses, and a section on the cycle of contributions and the rules that should govern it. We have emphasized the importance of the inter-linkages between these issues, in particular the direct relationship there is between mitigation ambition, adaptation needs and costs, and losses and damages suffered. We have made, jointly with Mexico, a concrete proposal on adaptation under the Paris Agreement. In this submission, we have explained the key components we expect, these include a global goal on adaptation, Gelleetive and individual adaptation commitments, means of implementation for adaptation, a vision on future institutional arrangements and the strengthening of metrics and assessments to enhance and catalyse effective adaptation action. We have presented ideas on how to continue to enhance the efforts undertaken under work stream 2, including concrete ideas on the TEMs, on how to capture and disseminate information resulting from the TEMs, and on ministerial engagement. Co-Chairs, We stand ready to engage with colleagues and continue our work, under your guidance, to reach ambitious consensus as soon as possible. We fully trust you to guide us through this endeavor, for which you have all our support, and can count on us for moving ahead decisively. This however cannot be achieved without the commitment of all of us to work together. This is why, through you, Co-Chairs, AILAC also would like to express that we fully trust the collaboration among all Parties, we count on all of them, and we will be reinforcing our efforts to reach out to all of them, in order to move forward together towards, towards the substantive draft decisions that we need over the coming weeks and months. Thank you.\"'],\n",
              "       ['87,2,6,6,20141020,basic,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, At the outset we wish to convey our appreciation to you for convening this additional ADP session in Bonn and for the documents you distributed since our last meeting. The non-paper, which seeks to present the various views of Parties, provide a good starting point for Parties as they commence formal negotiations in the Contact Group setting. It is our expectation that at this session Parties will make substantial progress towards delivering on the two agreed tasks of Lima from the Warsaw decision and in accordance with the mandate from Durban to finalise the elements for a draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreement, as well as identify the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their intended nationally-determined contributions (INDCs). Co-Chairs, The BASIC countries highlight the need for enhanced ambition, noting that delivery on existing commitments in the pre-2020 period by developed country Parties will contribute to the enhancement of trust and confidence that are indispensable for the successful conclusion of the 2015 agreement. In particular, we stress the need for clearer indications from developed countries on meeting their commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020 and beyond, in particular through meaningful and substantial contributions to the Green Climate Fund. We welcome the announcements made by some developed countries for the initial capitalisation of the GCF, and call on other developed countries to do likewise as soon as possible, but no later than the pledging session for the Fund\\x19s mobilisation in November 2014. We believe that the Lima COP is an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement, which requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention, in order to enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and achieve its Objective as stated in Article 2. As agreed at COP17 in Durban, the 2015 agreement should be in accordance with the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities. We would like to take this opportunity to re-emphasise that developed countries should take the lead in addressing climate change in accordance with their historical responsibilities, the latest available scientific evidence on climate change trends and the IPCC AR5. We urge developed countries to implement their commitments under the Convention towards developing countries for the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support and highlight the importance and relevance of Article 4.7 of the Convention in this regard. We reiterate that the six core elements for the 2015 outcome have been identified in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17 and that these should be addressed in a balanced and comprehensive manner through an open and transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-building process. We believe that the agreement must provide an inclusive, equitable and effective framework within which Parties can put forward their contributions to keep the world on a path to limiting the increase in average global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius. In this regard, the agreement should allow Parties to progressively enhance their contributions, without providing for regression on existing commitment. It is our view that Parties\\x19 intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) must cover mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building, in line with Parties\\x19 respective commitments under the Convention. We emphasise that the information that Parties will provide when putting forwards their INDCs would also need to be accordingly differentiated between the developed and developing countries in accordance with Article 12 of the Convention. We further stress that the purpose of such information is to facilitate the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDCs in accordance with the Warsaw decision. We are convinced that adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change, experienced both now and in the future. Adaptation is an issue which requires a global response and is as important as mitigation, and all elements in paragraph 5, decision 1/CP.17 should be treated in a balanced manner in the 2015 agreement. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) could be the basis for Parties\\x19 adaptation INDCs. Investment in adaptation by 3 developing countries would represent an adaptation contribution. Also, the Lima conference must ensure adequate resource allocation to the Adaptation Fund and the adaptation window of the Green Climate Fund. The Lima conference must provide clarity on how developing countries will be supported in the implementation of their contributions under the 2015 agreement, given the serious socio-economic challenges they face and their urgent efforts to eradicate poverty. The 2015 agreement must establish a clear link between the actions by developing countries to contribute to effectively addressing the climate change challenge and the scale of finance, technology and capacity-building support required by them for implementation. It is important that the 2015 agreement give effect to the principles of equity and CBDR&RC through implementation of provisions of the Convention that reflect Parties\\x19 common and differentiated commitments, related to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building. We believe that existing institutions and mechanisms created under the Convention should be used and further strengthened beyond 2020. The elements of the 2015 agreement should strengthen and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of climate action. This will be done through provisions to strengthen institutional linkages between the adaptation committee and the Technology Executive Committee with the Standing Committee on Finance with the GCF and other operating entities of the Convention??s Financial Mechanism. Co-Chairs, Regarding the pre-2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. We call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and emphasise the importance of revisiting and significantly increasing ambition of QELROs in 2014 and in line with what is required by science, and comparabl\"'],\n",
              "       ['88,2,6,6,20141020,eig,\"Mr. Co-Chairs, The EIG countries have come here to build on the positive signals given at the UN Climate Summit by many Parties. I am pleased to to inform you that EIG members have announced during the recent UN Climate Summit financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund: Mexico has announced 10 Millon US$, Korea has announced a contribution up to 100 Million US$ including the existing pledge and Switzerland has announced that it is considering a contribution of at least 100 Million US$. The EIG members are ready to capitalize the GCF, we hope others as well! The EIG countries are very committed to agree by Lima on elements of a draft negotiation text of the 2015 Agreement, on ex-ante information and on the modalities of the INDC process. Further we must set up a robust process to identify options to enhance global mitigation ambition. The EIG thanks you for the issued draft texts on INDCs and enhance pre-2020 climate action as well as the non-paper on elements on Parties\\' views and proposals on the elements for a draft negotiating text. We support your approach in guiding us to a successful outcome in Lima and are ready to work on the basis of the issued draft texts. We support your aim to finalize the draft decisions on INDCs and enhance pre-2020 climate action here at this session in Bonn. In parallel, we also must advance here by identifying jointly what elements are supported by all Parties to be in the enduring new instrument to come into effect from 2020. It is with this goal that we have to work on the basis of the non-paper on elements on Parties\\' views and proposals on the elements for a draft negotiating text. Let me also briefly- before we need to go to work urgently- confirm, that all the EIG Parties are sincerely engaged in domestic preparations of their INDCs and are strongly committed to a timely communication ahead of COP21 of their INDCs and the up front information ensuring clarity, transparency and understanding. The EIG takes the view that it is important to ensure a process that allows for clear, transparent and understandable mitigation commitments. A similar bottom-up approach may also be beneficial for adaptation. However, such a process on adaptation would have to reflect important differences between adaptation and mitigation, it would have to follow different timelines, and the followup to the submission of national development strategies and plans would have to be adaptation specific. The EIG therefore sees a benefit of outlining also in Lima a specific bottom-up approach with regard to adaptation. Let me also bring to your attention that the EIG countries support a multilateral process on the INDCs starting from the first quarter 2015 and accommodation all Parties and their circumstances. Such a multilateral process should be facilitative, non-intrusive, non-punitive where all Parties share information on the underlying effort of their INDCs and their considerations on equity, fairness and CBDR/RC regarding their INDC in view of the 2 degrees goal. Such a process will demonstrate that each Parties INDC is part of a collective, global effort to combat climate change. In short: the process should allow for clarification, compilation, calibration with what is needed to achieve the 2 degrees objective, and set the basis for cooperation to close a possible gap. It will build trust in the run up to Paris and set a good basis to consider enhanced action through international cooperative initiatives. Mr. Co-Chair, we are ready to work with you on the documents provided towards a successful COP in Lima. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",
              "       ['89,2,6,6,20141020,eu,\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. As this week represents the last time that we will formally meet before Lima, it is crucial that we work to make progress so as to advance key areas in preparation for a successful outcome at COP 20. We have set out our priority areas in our recent ADP submissions. Firstly it is essential that we make progress towards agreeing the decision on intended nationally determined contributions, to be adopted in Lima. We have a clear mandate on this from Warsaw. Given that we expect all Parties that are ready to do so ? including all major and emerging economies ? to come forward by the first quarter of 2015 with their INDCs, adopting a decision in Lima that ensures transparent, quantifiable, comparable and ambitious mitigation commitments is essential. The decision should also provide for an international process before COP 21 to consider and analyse the INDCs presented by Parties in order to take stock of the aggregate level of ambition in relation to the below 2?C objective as well as to allow Parties to present the ambition and fairness of their contributions. We would also like to consider the ideas of some Parties on using the pre COP 21 process to facilitate Parties coming forward with INDCs. We should aim to have agreed this decision by time we leave Bonn, working from the co-Chairs\\' draft as a basis. We have provided some comments on that text in our recent ADP submission. Secondly we must make progress towards further defining and clarifying the elements of the 2015 Agreement, with a view to adopting a draft elements text in Lima. With only a few months remaining before a full negotiating text needs to be tabled, Lima is a critical step. Our mandate is to agree a draft elements text at COP 20 and we must stick to that \\x13 we do not agree with those who suggest otherwise. The following four areas of the 2015 Agreement need to have a particular focus in this session: First, the role of INDCs in operationalising differentiation. Second, the MRV, accounting and compliance rules base ? in particular which rules need to be agreed by COP 21 to allow the finalisation of mitigation commitments by all Parties in Paris. Third, A cycle for regularly strengthening mitigation ambition by all Parties after 2020. Fourth, What to include in the 2015 Agreement and accompanying decisions in relation to adaptation and support, building on existing institutions and processes. We have set out some ideas on these areas in our submission and we would like to exchange on these with other Parties. We welcome the co-Chairs\\' elements non-paper as a useful attempt to capture the views expressed by Parties. However in our submission we have highlighted that there are a number of aspects where we consider the EU position is not well reflected. We also consider that it is essential that during this session the options on key elements of the 2015 Agreement are rationalised to move to a simpler and more concise document. We also need to move towards identifying those issues on which Ministerial guidance will be needed to agree the elements text in Lima. In that context the recent submissions from various Parties serve as useful input. Thirdly we need to continue to make progress on increasing pre-2020 mitigation ambition of all Parties in order to adopt a decision on this in Lima. It was encouraging that a large number of countries, private sector entities and other organisations came together at the UN Secretary General??s Climate Summit to launch initiatives to reduce emissions in the pre-2020 period. We should build on this momentum and find effective ways to move forward in 2015 and beyond. Discussions in June and \"'],\n",
              "       ['90,2,6,6,20141020,g77china,\"Climate change is one of the most serious global challenges of our time. We underscore the fact that developing countries continue to suffer the most from the adverse impacts of climate change, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and the impact of response measures, even though they are historically the least responsible for climate change. Accordingly, we call for developed countries to take the lead in responding to climate change. Climate change threatens not only the development prospects of developing countries and their achievement of sustainable development but also the very existence and survival of countries, societies and the ecosystems of our Mother Earth. Developed countries, given their historical responsibility, have to take the lead in addressing the challenge of climate change in accordance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, particularly the principle of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and provide financial and technological support to developing countries in a transparent, adequate and predictable manner. We reaffirm our determination to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties at its twenty-first session (December 2015) which will come into effect and be implemented from 2020. We further reaffirm that the agreement should encompass, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support as elements, and to organize our work with a view to making available a negotiating text before May 2015. There is an urgent need to close the pre-2020 ambition gap. We express concern about the lack of fulfillment of commitments by developed countries. In addressing this gap, the focus must not be limited to mitigation only but also address gaps relating to finance, technology and support for capacity-building. We emphasize that developed countries must take robust and ambitious mitigation commitments, with ambitious quantitative targets for limiting and reducing emissions, as required by science and mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Increasing pre-2020 ambition must be achieved inter alia the acceleration of the implementation of the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the outcome of the Bali Action Plan in accordance with principles and provisions of the Convention, with developed country Parties taking the lead. The extent to which developing countries will effectively implement their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will depend on the effective implementation by developed countries of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding 3 priorities of developing countries, including in the context of the right to development. Mr. Co-Chairs, Developing country Parties that have not yet communicated a nationally appropriate mitigation actions, are urged to do so at the earliest possible opportunity in accordance with their respective national circumstances, in the context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, finance and capacity-building, consistent with the provisions of the Convention. Developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex I of the Convention shall implement without delay their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention and, if also a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, their quantified emission limitation or reduction commitment for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We call for the ADP contact group that we launched in March to allocate time here in Bonn to further our work on paragraphs 3 and 4 of Decision 1/CP.19. Mr. Co-Chairs, The G77 and China reaffirms that developed country Parties shall strive to implement policies and measures to respond to climate change in such a way as to avoid negative social and economic consequences for developing country Parties, taking into account Article 3, Article 4.8, Article 4.9 and Article 4.10 of the Convention, and shall assist these Parties to address such consequences by providing support to highly vulnerable countries in particular LDCs and SIDS. Developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex I of the Convention shall revisit their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, with the aim of increasing such targets or commitments to at least 40% below 1990 levels by the year 2020 and adjusting, resolving or removing any conditions associated with their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. Enhanced action and international cooperation on adaptation is urgently required to enable and support the implementation? of adaptation actions aimed at reducing vulnerability and building resilience in developing countries, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing countries that are particularly vulnerable. The 2015 outcome needs to reflect a long-term vision that will ultimately help Parties in particular developing countries undertake adaptation, going beyond building resilience. We stress that adaption is an additional development burden and requires significant support from developed countries. In this context, we reiterate the need to scale up adaptation finance in accordance with provision and principles of the Convention, in particular Art 4. Mr. Co-Chairs, The Group believes that the process for the formulation and implementation of NAPs is key for communicating and supporting adaptation and this must clearly reflected. The 2015 agreement should recognize the diversity of individual and collective adaptation efforts and contain links to finance support by developed country Parties. Technology development and transfer from developed countries and Annex II Parties to developing countries is a key enabling element for ensuring 5 ? enhanced mitigation and adaptation actions by developing countries. Effective and enhanced climate change actions by developing country Parties depend on the effective provision of support, including finance, for technology development and transfer from developed country Parties. A provision should be incorporated in the agreement .to enhance action on the development and transfer of technologies and know-how, including financing of transfer and access, and the removal of barriers. There is an urgent need to have a clear commitment of Developed country Parties to provide at least USD70 billion per year by 2016 rising to USDlOO billion per year by 2020 as a floor for accounting, and leading to further increased commitments on the provision of financial support for the post2020 period. A clear roadmap, including targets, timelines and sources, is needed to ensure the scaling up the finance. The financial support should be primarily from public sources and only supplemented by private sources. We need to operationalize what we have agreed regarding issues of adequacy, accessibility, predictability, sustainability, additionally and transparency of the ?provision of finance by developed countries. As a priority, the 2015 agreement shall reflect the need to finance adaptation and deal with the gaps in this regard while maintaining balanced support of both adaptation and mitigation. To the extent possible, current mechanisms such as the standing committee on finance should be utilized and allow for ambitious, sustainable and predictable resources for the financial mechanism, including clear quantified pathways and short and long-term quantified goals. The Green Climate Fund should be strengthened and anchored in the new agreement. The issue of early and full capitalization of GCF should be considered as a priority action to fulfill the pledges of the Developed Countries. Its initial capitalization should be immediate and at a very significant level. Mr. Co-Chairs, It is important to develop a mechanism for the measurement, reporting and verification of support. provided to developing country Parties in order to ensure transparency, predictability and sustainability of the provision of support resources ensuring compliance by developed country Parties with their financial obligations. Developed country Parties, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other organizations in a position to do so, should provide support to developing country Parties for the preparation of their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), communication of information on their INDCs, and implementation of their enhanced actions after 2020. The adverse impacts of climate change are devastating societies in the developing world, threating the right to development and threatening the survival of peoples and nations. Developing countries are suffering from the permanent effects of extreme weather events that are drastically undermining progress achieved in poverty eradication and sustainable development. We need structural solutions to the climate crisis as well as immediate measures in order to address the impacts of extreme events. The COP has acknowledged that loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change includes, and in some cases exceeds, that which can be reduced by adaptation. Therefore, The G77 and China calls for the inclusion of the Warsaw international mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts, established at COP19, in the 2015 agreed outcome, as an additional element of the 2015 agreement. Because Intended Nationally Determined Contributions represent the effort each country is willing to make in the global effort to fight climate change, they must be seen in a balanced and comprehensive context pursuant to 7 decisions 1/CP .17, 2/CP .18 and. 1/CP .19 in accordance with the principles and provisions of the convention. Developed country parties shall provide finance, technology transfer and capacity-building support. Developing countries will require provision of adequate support for their domestic preparations of their intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon, as well as for the implementation of their enhanced action. The G77 attaches particular importance to the issue of the legal form of the 2015 agreement and therefore calls for a proper discussion in that regard. The elements identified in decision 1/CP.19, paragraph 2(a) namely mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity building, development and transfer of technologies and transparency of action and support must be treated on an equal footing. The provisions of the 2015 agreement should focus on enhanced actions under these six core elements recognizing the importance of addressing loss and damage in the 2015 agreement. The Group of 77 and China views Workstream II (WSII) as an integral part of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban ??platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) and as linked to the success of Workstream I (WSI). Enhanced pre2020 ambition will not only provide a strong basis for post-2020 cooperation, but is also necessary to avoid higher costs and risks associated with adaptation and mitigation in the long run. As we engage in a Contact Group setting, our work must reflect balanced progress in both workstreams, as well as between workstreams. Through WS II, all countries should demonstrate their political will recognizing that developed countries shall take the lead through enhanced\"'],\n",

We reiterate our confidence in your ongoing leadership of the ADP in Lima. We welcome the issuance of the revised texts for decisions on IDCs information and on Workstream Two, and while we too retain concerns over their content, we consider they will be a useful basis for further discussion in Lima. We also look forward to further refinement of the elements of a draft negotiating text. We need to move towards more coherence and refine the various proposals. We look for further iterations of your non-paper to be coherent, accurate and put an emphasis on areas where there is, or likely to be, convergence. We look forward to working further with you and all parties in Lima. Thank you \"'],\n",
              "       ['92,2,6,6,20141020,lmdc,\"Co-Chairs, colleagues, good morning. Ecuador has the honour of delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries in Climate Change. We fully endorse the statement delivered by the Plurinational State of Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs We are now at a critical juncture in the work of the ADP. While we are still 5 weeks away from meeting again Lima at COP20 and 15 months away from COP2 I in Paris, we only have 6 working days in this session here in Bonn this week. So little time, yet sti ll so much to do. As developing countries within whose borders live 4 out of every 5 of the world\\'s poor who survive on less than $2 a day, our countries are among those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change on our economies, our societies, and our sustainable development prospects for the future, as well as also being vulnerable to the adverse social and economic consequences of response measures. Hence, achieving a balanced, comprehensive, and ambitious outcome under the Convention in both Lima and Paris that moves us towards addressing climate change effectively is of great importance to us. Like other Parties, we look forward to working with all Parties, with you Co-Chairs, and the incoming COP President Peru to ensure that Lima produces successful outcomes in line with the mandates coming from Durban and agreed tasks from Doha and Warsaw, and will build a good foundation for success in Paris on enhancing the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. We expect, in particular, that significant progress will be made at this session in: Fleshing out the elements for the draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreed outcome; Identifying the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions; and Accelerating the implementation of the Bali outcomes to enhance the pre-2020 ambition on mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology under Workstream 2. Our process in the ADP must be open, transparent,  inclusive, and Party-driven, and built on the consensus under which negotiating texts are collectively constructed by Parties based on their inputs and submissions. We should formally negotiate with each other in the Contact Group format, rather than have informal bilateral dialogues between different Parties and groups of Parties. In order to make progress in this session and achieve a successful outcome in Lima, the negotiations should be concentrated on the core tasks agreed by the Warsaw decision - elements and information -without overburdening our work by adding other issues outside the agreed tasks from Warsaw. Co-Chairs, We appreciate your work in putting together your non-paper on elements in which you have compiled Parties\\' views on the elements for the draft negotiating text of the 2015 agreed outcome in a bullet-point format. This non-paper can be a useful starting point for Parties to negotiate with each other in a formal and focused mode of work focusing on the six core elements in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17. This will let us make substantial progress on the elements as rapidly as possible, keeping in mind that the views expressed by Parties as well as any conference room papers that Parties may have put forward remain on the table during such negotiations. The questions to be discussed must be on basis of the concrete and specific issues under the six core elements raised by Parties, rather than another round of \\'open questions\\' to be set in a pick-and-choose approach. Advancing the work on further elaborating the elements should be the primary focus of the work of the ADP during the October 2014 Bonn session, and hence more time in the Contact Group should be allocated to the six core elements in a balanced and equal manner, avoiding a focus merely on mitigation. The elements are the key to a successful conclusion of the 2015 agreement. Co-Chairs, The preparation of INDCs is not an independent task, another workstream or additional process beyond the existing workstreams under the ADP process. The INDCs is not an end but a means to achieve the end to adopting the 2015 agreement. The provisions of the 2015 agreement should focus on enhanced actions for the implementation of the Convention after 2020 and should not be an INDCs agreement. Therefore, the INDCs should be discussed within the context of elements. You have put forward for the consideration of Parties a draft decision on intended nationally determined contributions. We appreciate your efforts. However, we have to note that the draft decision is not a text from the Parties and it contains ideas and concepts that do not reflect any consensus arising from Party-driven negotiations. Additionally, the document goes beyond the agreed task from Warsaw, which is only to identify the information that TNDCs could contain. The theme of the draft outcome in Lima should be the INFORMATION that Parties will provide when putting forward their INDCs and not the INDCs themselves or other issues such as an ex-ante consideration process related to JNDCs, which are totally outside the agreed task from Warsaw. The Warsaw decision does not provide for expanding the discussion with respect to information to issues such as ex ante or ex post consultation, assessment or review or for narrowing the scope of INDCs only to mitigation. These should be properly discussed during the negotiations on elements. We have already put forward a draft decision text as a conference room paper on the information. We are ready to engage in negotiations on information right away, and call on all Parties to focus on putting forward their own texts on information for direct Party-driven negotiations. Co-Chairs, On Workstream 2, we note that there have been some ideas and inputs coming from the TEMs since the March session. It is necessary to conclude on the possible further arrangements of the TEMs. What is sorely lacking in this paper in its treatment of TEMs is what the Convention stresses on \"\"facilitation of access to and financing transfer of technology.\"\" Everything related to mitigation in the Convention is only related to technology development and transfer, of knowledge, processes and practices. This must be the focus of any work on mitigation and energy efficiency in the ADP. However, the workplan on enhancing pre-2020 ambition does not merely include TEMs. There are other even more important issues relating to enhancing pre-2020 ambition that need to be discussed. These include accelerating the implementation of the provision by developed countries of finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries as part of the implementation of the Bali Action Plan outcome; the ratcheting up of mitigation ambition by Annex I Parties to at least 40% below 1990 level by 2020 through the Revisit Mechanism; and ensuring that the institutions and mechanisms that have already been set up under the Convention are made fully operational and effective in providing support to developing countries. These key tasks have been set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. The operationalization of these paragraphs is an integral and essential part of the workplan on pre-2020 ambition. There should be enough time allocated in this session to further our work on these paragraphs of Warsaw decision. We want an outcome in Workstream 2 that results in real action on the ground to accelerate the implementation of these issues rather than causing further delay in actual implementation or further backsliding from commitments under the Convention. Your draft decision, Co-Chairs, falls short in this regard. Hence, we look forward to Parties putting forward their own draft texts focusing on operationalization of paragraph 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision and to engaging directly with Parties on that basis. We will continue to work with you, Co-Chairs, through our active, constructive, progressive, and positive engagement and involvement in these negotiations. Thank you, Co-Chairs.\"'],\n",

I would like to align my statement with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, and by Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. We thank the Secretariat for the preparations made for this meeting, and also thank the government and people of Germany for their warm hospitality. We are grateful for your continued efforts to keep us up-to-date throughout the inter-session period. The documents prepared by you have been very useful, and will help us to progress here in Bonn and in Lima. This October ADP meeting plays a decisive role in our work towards the 2015 agreement. During the next six days, we have to discuss issues of utmost importance related to both the pre-2020 and post-2020 negotiation processes. Parties should build upon commonalities and work towards narrowing divergent views. Therefore, we urge all Parties to make the best use of the time available at this session. Co-chairs, We believe that Parties need to advance the elements of the draft negotiation text in a way that will help us to make a text available before May next year. The elements of the agreement were set up as initial parameters for the ADP at its inception. We need to progress in defining how each element will be reflected in the core of the legally binding 2015 agreement. In parallel, Parties should progress on the development of details regarding effective implementation of all these elements. The bullet points you made available to us present a reasonable spectrum of views and should help us to progress towards refinement. However, there are some elements that require further elaboration and we will bring forward some additional elements at this session. We believe the next step is to organize the elements in an appropriate format. We hope we will be able to do this after this session. Co-chairs, Progressing the discussion on INDCs and related information requirements, as well as on the definition of their scope, legal form and treatment once they are formulated, is of paramount importance to our group. We share your hope that Parties make substantial progress in refining the draft decision text in Bonn so that it can be adopted in Lima. It will be beneficial, if again, Parties in their discussions continue to clarify how they view the relationship between INDCs and the agreement. The LDC Group is of the view that these two are complementary. While we respect the views of Parties to present information they find relevant, we believe INDCs should primarily focus on mitigation. Adaptation and means of implementation, which are fundamental for the LDCs, should be addressed in the core of agreement and reflect the international community\\'s obligation to fulfill the needs for the most vulnerable countries so that they can cope with the adverse effects of climate change. Furthermore, the agreement should provide clear guidance to the financial mechanism to fulfill these obligations and provide resources to the operating entities. Co-chairs, It is paramount that the discussions on pre-2020 ambition build upon the outcomes of the UN Climate Summit. We should maintain this momentum by working toward a conclusion on the draft decision put forward. Let us take stock of the implementation of previous agreements, provide further guidance to the TEMs, establish a process to give consideration to how the workplan can be taken forward after 2015 and consider the role it could play after 2020. Finally Co-chairs, The LDC Group is committed to and will remain actively engaged in this process. We believe that we can have successful negotiations in Lima under your strong leadership, which in turn will build the foundations for a successful conclusion of the ADP??s work in Paris. Thank you Co-chairs.\"'],\n",

At the outset, SICA associates itself with the statement delivered on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Our region is strongly committed to the achievement of concrete results in the ADP before Lima and Paris in line with the mandate to further advancing the Durban Platform. We would like to thank the Co-Chairs for their efforts and at the same time recognize that there is much work to be done. As we begin this session, we are mindful of the limited time left to complete our work. We must therefore proceed with a sense of urgency, switching gears to start active negotiations. SICA underscores that adaptation needs to be strengthened in the context of the 2015 Agreement and the Adaptation Committee should be anchored in this agreement. On finance, there is an urgent need to have clear commitments, and provide clarity on scaling up the mobilization of 100 billion USD per year by 2020 to assist developing countries in both adaption and mitigation. SICA countries call on all Parties to work constructively on the elements for a draft negotiating text, on information for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and on the work-plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to help close the pre-2020 ambition gap. With respect to INDCs, we stress the need to include all the elements of the ADP mandate. Further, we consider that the required information to be submitted should be based on the provisions of the convention and relevant decisions. SICA countries underscore the centrality of the principles and provisions of the Convention, including, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and the most recent scientific evidence, in the execution of the ADP mandate. These are the foundation upon which we can elaborate an ambitious, durable and effective agreement that will promote the participation of all parties in the fulfillment of the ultimate objective of the Convention. Given that we have decided that the ADP is intended to produce a protocol, other legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force, we must initiate discussions on the issues that would arise from a legally binding agreement, that includes the legal implications of the different elements. We support the call for consideration of the establishment a contact group, at the proper time, that will consider legal aspects of such an agreement that have yet to be addressed. Mr. Chairman, Considering SICA??s role in enhancing climate change education and capacity building, we would like to underscore the importance of all elements of Article 6, which are fundamental for the effective implementation of the 2015 agreement. We are in the process of considering a submission on this matter. Mr. Chairman, We look forward over the next six days to working with you and with other Parties to ensure that we march steadily on to Lima.

The Group wishes to highlight three points on the way forward. First, we believe this session has been a good opportunity for Parties to enhance their understanding of one another\\x19s perspectives. We are encouraged that Parties are starting to consider middle\\x10ground possibilities on issues of high importance; in particular, those that relate to the elements of the draft negotiation text, the intended nationally determined contributions and related upfront information. This reflects a common acknowledgment by Parties that we must make urgent and substantial progress in the negotiations. This is not least to respect the highly constrained timeline we have agreed to. Second, and related to what I have just stated, we must consider the elements of the draft negotiating text at COP\\x1020 in Lima. This is absolutely critical because, as you have rightly reminded us from the beginning of this session, the draft negotiating text mu\"'],\n",
              "       ['96,2,6,6,20141020,umbrella,\"Umbrella Group countries are committed to delivering the ADP\\'s mandate at Paris. Time is short. We are ready to work with you and all Parties, to deliver outcomes that are ambitious, effective, durable, promote global participation and co-operation, and set us on a pathway to address climate change in tandem with building global prosperity. Co-Chairs, We know what we have been asked to deliver at Lima - elements for a negotiating text, and clarity on the information to accompany intended nationally determined contributions. We trust you, Co-Chairs, to lead us in the challenge of realizing these aims. To make them a reality we must now prioritise our negotiating time to ensure success. We see the Paris outcome as a package with three components: the legally binding agreement, schedules, and COP decisions including on INDCs. A first priority must be to give countries the guidance they need to prepare and communicate INDCs well in advance of Paris, and by the first quarter of 2015 if ready. We are ready to negotiate a decision that: Gives guidance on the upfront information that will help countries prepare clear, understandable and quantifiable emission reduction contributions; Clarifies how intended contributions will be considered after they are submitted, to aid understanding of individual countries\\' efforts and overall effort. We also think it will be essential to achieve better clarity on several key dimensions of future nationally determined contributions - including the length of initial contributions, methodological approaches, the approach to accounting rules, and ensuring the final form of contributions supports the broadest possible participation. These issues will be material to Parties\\' ability to finalise contributions, so must be a near term priority. Co-Chairs, The Warsaw decision made clear that INDCs are nationally determined. But to meet our global goal, it is essential all countries contribute to reducing or limiting emissions. Umbrella Group countries see# the up-front processes in 2015 - including upfront information and ex-ante consideration - as processes designed to be fit for the purpose of building collective confidence in contributions toward the Convention\\'s overall objective of reducing global emissions.  In tandem, we must consider approaches that are fit for purpose for other elements of the 2015 agreement, including adaptation and support. We will also need to consider how to embed a cycle of contributions over the longer term, and design a transparency framework that supports the agreement. So another priority for this session must be to generate a more focused understanding of the elements for the 2015 agreement. The outcome from Lima should set us up to establish core provisions for Paris Agreement and areas to be further elaborated in COP decisions. This needs to recognize the parameters of the common rule-set we\\'ll all be working towards. Transparency and accountability provisions using a common framework will be critical for an effective and credible agreement. If we are to reach agreement on elements for a draft negotiating text, we will need a more concise, streamlined and structured elements document that: Draws out the areas which can genuinely form a basis for agreement in Paris; Starts to delineate what the Paris agreement itself should contain, and what complementary, as well as subsequent decisions can elaborate. We trust you to guide us - as you have done - through the next step of generating a more concise and focused elements document for Lima, refiecting on our discussions at this and previous sessions, and submissions made by the full range of Parties and Groups. Co-Chairs, A further priority is to continue the useful progress the ADP continues to make on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition through workstream 2. The technical expert meetings have demonstrated how countries can build enabling environments and overcome barriers to effective mitigation action. Importantly, they are also bringing into our discussions international and regional organizations, sub-national entities and the private sector. We look forward to this session\\'s meetings on carbon capture, storage and use, and short-lived greenhouse gas emissions. We need to continue to take stock of the expert meetings we have held throughout the year, including hearing examples of how our discussions may be bearing fruit back at home and the domestic context. In considering how we take this work forward into next year, we need to ensure we maintain the practical, educational and co-operative focus that has made the technical expert meetings a success. We also need to keep in mind how further requirements under this workstream may impact Parties\\' and the UNFCCC\\'s resources in tandem with intensive negotiations and preparations for Paris. Co-Chairs, The Umbrella Group sees a critical condition to our success: that is ensuring that the ADP builds a genuinely global, common legal platform for climate action by all. That is the core of our mandate. That platform should recognise national differences, and promote efforts that are appropriate to each country\\'s circumstances and capacities. But it cannot afford to perpetuate a divided world view. Co-Chairs, We continue to offer you our ongoing support in your leadership of this process. We look forward to working with all Parties to deliver a successful ADP outcome in Lima.\"'],\n",
              "       ['97,2,6,6,20141025,lmdc,\"Ecuador is delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. Co-Chairs, we are strongly dissatisfied about the process of this Contact Group so far. Instead of undertaking direct negotiations among the Parties on drafting text, we have lost valuable negotiating time this week with more open-ended discussions. This leaves us very concerned about how you plan to organize our work in Lima. We must be clear. At Lima, we expect the process to change from the very first day. We expect to see the Contact Group start direct negotiations among the Parties. We want to see draft texts from Parties on screen, on paper, being directly negotiated by the Parties with each other, in order to narrow differences, find convergence, and achieve consensus. We support what the BASIC countries and the African Group have called for, that the Contact Group set up focused open-ended groups of Parties to work on drafting and concluding texts. These focused groups must have clear mandates, co-facilitated in a balanced way by developed and developing country colleagues selected by the Parties themselves, and focused on addressing issues identified and raised by Parties and which need to be settled among themselves. Draft texts can come only from Parties and have legal standing as a negotiating basis when they are submitted as CRPs. The COP\\x19s rules of procedure as applied to the ADP do not allow the co-Chairs to exercise the rights of Parties and table texts, as you are both well aware. We know that you will adhere to the Party-driven process. We want to help you with that. This is why we expect a shift in the mode of our work in the Contact Group to a formal and direct negotiating mode among the Parties through elements-focused drafting groups from Day 1 in Lima. We do not want to lose more time. We said before that convergence and consensus cannot simply be declared into being, these have to be negotiated. As a Party-driven process, it is up to Parties to discover and decide through direct negotiations where areas of convergence exist and consensus can be achieved. As Co-Chairs, we look to you to facilitate the negotiations by accurately reflecting all Parties\\x19 views rather than exercising your own judgment on where convergence and consensus may lie. Co-Chairs, we can live with something that we have collectively worked on and negotiated together with other Parties, but not with something that has simply been handed down to us without the benefit of actual intergovernmental negotiations. Such negotiations must take place, to ensure that Lima and Paris will achieve balanced, comprehensive and consensus-based outcomes. Under the Convention, Parties have to actively make a decision by consensus, rather than assume that a decision is adopted unless Parties have a consensus to reject it.

We would like to associate ourselves with the statement delivered by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chairs, we thank Parties for sharing their views on what they would like to see in the 2015 agreement. We heard new ideas and further elaboration of ideas that where captured particularly in your Non-Paper, the draft INDC decision and the Workstream II draft text. With regard to the draft decision on INDCs, the BASIC countries have made clear their position in this session that we do not believe a stand-alone decision on the INDCs will help us in reaching a successful outcome in Paris. Furthermore, we would like to express our disappointment on how the discussions of this session were reflected on the latest version of the text, in an unbalanced and selective manner. The latest version does not \\x1cbuild the bridges\\x1d we all expected this session would. Co-Chairs, we would also like to register our disappointment on how we proceeded on the ELEMENTS discussions. We do not feel that significant progress was made at this session. Our expectation was that we would have a first reading of the Non-Paper in this session. The mode of work at this session was not conducive to capturing emerging consensus or common ground. Co-Chairs, the BASIC countries would like to support the suggestions made by the Group of 77 & China on how to organise our work for Lima. Since Lima is expected to finalise the draft elements for a draft negotiating text, it is clear is that we cannot continue in the current mode of engagement. Co-Chairs, we therefore call for an agreement here in Bonn that we start the ADP session in Lima in FOCUSED GROUPS. For this to happen we would like to propose to you, Co-Chairs, that you appoint facilitators for such groups. Co-Chairs, the mandate for the focused groups should be to produce elements for a draft negotiating text. The basis of those discussions should be your Non-Paper. We therefore would like to give you mandate to update the current non-paper and structure it to suit the suggested focused group discussions WITHOUT deleting anything from the current Non-Paper. The BASIC countries will not accept the deletion of any content of the current Non-Paper as we did not yet have a first reading of the Non-Paper. Co-Chairs, just to emphasise the points that we are making in this statement, we propose the following: that we agree to start the Lima ADP negotiations with the FOCUSED groups; and ? that the focused groups should use the updated Non-Paper as the basis of the discussion. If we can reach an agreement here in Bonn on the mode of work in Lima, it will make our task in Lima much easier. We should start the Lima discussion in a focused manner\"'],\n",

This week\\'s discussions highlight the urgent need to work constructively and decisively in a more focused manner to secure the Lima outcomes. Co-Chairs the modality of work of this session has been helpful in furthering the understanding of each other\\'s position, we now need to engage in a modality of work that allows for more focused negotiations .. We have significant conceptual progress during this session. These include issues such as the need for global goals on mitigation, means of implementation and adaptation. AR5 has indicated the need for a carbon-neutral global economy by mid-century. We want a planet that is resilient to the impacts of climate change and where all investments are directed towards low carbon and climate-resilient development. This will provide the required longer-term guidance that will support a global transformation. We have heard interesting ideas this week on the issues of differentiation, cycles, sequencing, and the need to design the appropriate vehicles for action in the new climate regime. AILAC is eager to hear furth~r detail on these ideas from our negotiating Partners. We share a collective commitment to make adaptation a central part of the agreement. A balanced outcome that reflects all the elements of the ADP is fundamental to account for the interlinkages between all of them, and that mitigation ambition and adaptation action require of the provision of means of implementation to secure the desired enhanced levels of ambition. Work under WS2 must urgently address the significant pre-2020 mitigation gap resulting from the existing mitigation commitments, targets and pledges and the aggregate level of ambition needed to reach below 2 degree or 1.5 Celsius goal, in order to secure enhanced mitigation ambition in the short term by all Parties. Co Chairs, We commend your efforts to guide our discussions and identify areas of convergence. In this spirit, let us point out some important concerns regarding the most recent version of the INDC draft decision. We feel that this new iteration doesn\\'t reflect progress made by all parties during this session. Despite parties\\' efforts to elaborate on the details on how Adaptation and Means of implementation need to be reflected both in the body and Annex of the decision, we find that this new version blurs the contents of these two elements within the decision, rather than building on the many clarifications and details provided by Parties. Co-Chairs, We are set to define here a long-term system. We need to keep this focus. We can\\'t afford to miss the opportunity we have now in our hands to make the future regime operative. The INDCs are one of the vehicles to achieve this, none of the Parties have rejected that idea. The purpose of INDCs, beyond clarity, transparency and understanding of the contributions, is to reflect contributions of each country to meet the ultimate objective of the convention as well as any other goals to be set forth in the new agreement. The decision we take in Lima needs to provide a space to improve ambition if the aggregate effort falls short. This needs to be made possible for the short, medium and long term. The new version of the text creates a greater unbalance, and plays down the robustness on science and equity within the assessment process of communicated contributions in the context of global goals that are to be reflected within the 2015 Agreement. While we recognize that contributions are nationally determined, AILAC strongly favors the definition of specific elements that define the necessary guidance that the Convention must provide to the work of the Parties towards achieving its ultimate objective. Top-down elements are necessary for this regime to deliver on its objectives. This text moves further away from this objective. Co-Chairs, let us be clear: we welcome your bold guidance and your effort. We ascertain the crucial role that we expect you to play in driving us forward to reach consensus. We recognize the value of your initiative and urge you to capture the broader spectrum of requests for greater. Hence we encourage you to produce a new version for Lima that captures this week\\'s spirit, ideas and proposals, while conducting further consultations with Parties. AILAC is an ambitious yet pragmatic group, solution-oriented and flexible. We are ready to listen to new ideas, revisit ours with an aim to reach and ambitious outcome in. Thank you. \"'],\n",

The text on Lima outcomes on the ADP should be collectively constructed by Parties, based on the inputs from Parties and reflect various views and options in a balanced, objective, inclusive, comprehensive and Party-driven manner. We are concerned about the fact that the Draft Text on ADP 2-6 Agenda Item 3 Implementation of Decision 1/CP .17, \"\"Information on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions\"\" lacks of central elements that are part of the principles and provisions of the Convention, which are among others the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities. These elements have been removed from the second version of Draft Text. This sends a signal that the documents produced by the Co-Chairs are not balanced and fall short from reflecting the positions of all Parties. The Co-Chairs should facilitate the negotiation identifying the areas of convergence and divergence in a balanced manner and promote negotiation among Parties. We consider it is urgent that we have the opportunity to interact among Parties on specific issues with focused negotiations, and trust that we will move towards such an organization of work in Lima. Central issues repeatedly stated by the Group like the appropriate balance in the core elements, are not reflected in the last document presented by the Co-Chairs. The Draft Text on ADP 2-6 Agenda Item 3 Implementation of all the elements of Decision 1/CP .17, \"\"Information on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions\"\" does not reflect other constructive proposals by Parties. Mr. Co-Chairs, We have concerns on the lack of progress on drafting the text on the elements of the Agreement. If we leave this session without clarity then we will repeat this very same process in Lima and this can put at risk the process for the Agreement. We do not want to be in a situation of \"\"take it or leave it\"\" or to have huddles in the last minute, due to the lack of interaction in the previous sessions. We have to modify the dynamic and the format of the sessions turning it into a negotiating Parties interaction. We are beginning to have huge political pressure from civil society, in order to have an outcome that brings solutions to climate change challenges. We need to start with a process with a text that reflects all proposals and allow us to negotiate. We need to have a clear arrangement on the organization of work in Lima, in order to avoid lack of progress and ensure the accomplishment of the agreed tasks from Warsaw. ??We propose to establish focused groups to enter into formal, focused and Party-driven negotiation in order to prepare draft text around all the core elements of the Agreement based on inputs from Parties in a collective, constructive and Party-driven manner. In accordance with paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17. We need a draft negotiation text on all the elements of ADP.

Allow me at the outset to express our appreciation to the Government and People of Peru for hosting this meeting, and the Convention Secretariat for the excellent arrangments. \"\"The African Group associates itself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group 77 and China. Co-Chairs, on Workstream I, The African Group reiterates the call we made at the 6th part of the 2nd session of the ADP. \"\"The AGN would like to see a single decision on post 2020 arrangements under the Durban mandate, covering both the INDC process and elements of the negotiating text. We proposed that you avail such a decision for Parties to consider during this opening plenary. Further, we called for assurance on a mode of work in the parallel sessions where Parties can engage directly with the text and each other; hence not rely on iterations by you, which have proved to miss some important points raised by some delegations. In light of limited time available in this session, and in trying to support you in working towards an ambitious outcome in Lima, we would welcome the appointment of facilitators who would assist you helping Parties engage on text. Co-chairs, having addressed how we undertake our work, the African Group would like to provide son1e key reflections on the substance of the documents you have prepared concerning workstream I, we would like to raise the following concerns, The mandate of the ADP with specific reference to the elements of the negotiating text has been reduced to making a recommendation, whilst the INDC process has been elevated to a mandate, and this is inconsistent with the Durban mandate, We are further of the view that the draft decision provides for concrete mitigation expectations whilst other elements are particularly adaptation and provision means of implementation are optional. The draft decision further prejudges what will be an integral part of the agreement and what will be complementary, which makes the text imbalanced The weakening of developed countries support obligations in the new agreement, whilst opening space for developing countries to provide support under the pretext of \\'parties in a position do so\\' is unacceptable as it changes the fundamental obligations under the Convention On the ex-ante assessment process, the references to science only pertain to implications of mitigation ambition on the temperature goal, however it should further explore the implications of the temperature goal to developing country adaptation burden. We are of the view that any assessment should include the assessment of means of implementation, particularly of adaptation support. Co-chairs, on the elements text we see some of our proposals reflected, some not accurately reflected, and we look forward to engaging with other Parties in textual negotiation, particularly in addressing aspects that seek to reinterpret the Convention. Co-Chairs, on Workstream II As the Group indicated to the COP President in our opening statement yesterday, we have to build on the technical expert meetings successes (TEM) and move towards a more structured technical expert process (TEP) that helps Parties deepen their analysis, catalyses new forms of cooperation, supports an upward cycle of cooperation and accelerate implementation of commitments under the Convention. In operationalizing such a vision, the Africa Group calls for the following sequence: The technical expert process or TEP is an organized set of technical expert meetings with a focus on the implementation of policies, practices and technologies that are substantial, scalable and replicable. The process would enable more systematic analysis of opportunities for cooperation on concrete actions to realize mitigation opportunities in different thematic areas in accordance with nationally defined development priorities. To help move from information to action, the outcomes of the various themes would be synthesized into a summary of actions and cooperation that together would help put the world on a path towards curbing emissions and realizing co-benefits in the pre-2020 period to achieve the objective of the Convention. It would summarize in politically relevant terms the opportunities for cooperation inside and outside the Convention, potential for syergies among different thematic areas, actions and co-benefits, and opportunities for high-level engagement and action. The objective of the process is to support ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION in practice, through action within and outside the Convention. It would support the development of concrete initiatives, such as the African proposed Global Renewable Energy Partnership to strengthen cooperation between developed and developing countries and speed the transition to renewable energy, while addressing energy poverty, empowering communities, increasing employment and supporting development On the Workplan and its timeline. The current Workstream II would culminate in a synthesis and launch of new initiatives in Paris. The first round of the TEP would run 2016-2017 and conclude with a synthesis outcome, high-level engagement on options for cooperation, and a review. In parallel with the review, a second round would run 2018-2019. The two-year iterative process would enable an upward cycle of ambition and cooperation. It would be aligned with other reviews - including those on finance - to help coordinate action on mitigation and other related areas. Co-chairs, as you suggested, the Africa Group already started talking and consulting with Groups and Parties on this proposal and other ways and n1eans to strengthen the work under Workstreams II as to put the world on track during the pre-2020 period to achieve the objective of the Convention. Co-chairs, in conclusion we welcome the recent pledges towards the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund and the very positive signal it sends as a reflection of the willingness of developed countries to honour their financial contributions under the Convention. We wish to reiterate that we are developing a long-term multilateral system that will affect Africa\\'s development far into the future. In this regard we wish to stress that our positions on adaptation and means of implementation are a reflection of the realities that Africa will face going forward under the new regime, and cannot be compromised on account of the positive assurances provided from developed countries in the short-term. The African Group stands ready to engage in this session as always, in an open and constructive manner to move the ADP towards achieving its important mandate for this session, which is to reach an agreement on the elements of a negotiation text for the 2015 agreement.

I begin by expressing AILAC\\'s appreciation for their effort and work in preparing the new documents: a draft decision for the ADP and a revised version of non-paper an effort to reflect the multiple elements that are have discussed during the previous Sessions. We have carefully studied both documents and we hope that on that basis we can move forward decisively in defining the contributions determined at the national level and in the elements of the 2015 Agreement. The members of AILAC, as developing countries, are committed to participate in a constructive dialogue with all the Parties under the ADP on the basis of these advances, and to continue building bridges to find more and more areas of convergence. We hope to make significant progress in this session and to ensure ambitious decisions. Co-Chairs, Lima is the decisive moment for the future of the multilateral regime, on climate change, based on rules that are currently being negotiated. At COP 20 we will lay the foundations for the architecture of an improved regime that will guide our collective and individual actions on climate change, which will lead us to a universal and legally binding agreement that will facilitate a low global economy. in carbon and possibly carbon neutral in the middle of this century, An ambitious result in Paris requires reaching substantive products here in Lima under the ADP, COP 20 should produce: \"\"Lima Draft\"\" that defines the elements for the new agreement, and is recognized as the basis for the advance ADP make a Paris Protocol during 2015. decision on the ADP that included the following The definition of ex-ante information for the preparation and communication of the nationally determined contributions in mitigation by all Parties, to guarantee transparency, clarity, understanding, comparability, aggregation and quantification. The definition of an initial ex-ante evaluation for the consideration of nationally determined contributions in mitigation in 2015. Provisions on contributions regarding adaptation and means of implementation that reflect the individual dimension of the action to face climate change. Accelerated action to increase the ambition for mitigation in the pre-2020 period and the efficiency of its work modalities, which will allow establishing the basis for appropriate post-2020 action, increasing political support. The new agreement is an opportunity to design an iterative system in which a virtuous circle of individual contributions generates positive incentives to increase ambition over time, with a view to achieving global goals. AlLAC emphasizes the need for the Paris Agreement to be durable, concrete, rule-based and ratifiable, with a system of national contributions from all the States Parties that is dynamic and increases the ambition over time1 towards sustainable development. AILAC supports the call made by many of the Parties to advance in a more focused modality of negotiation avoiding the parallel proliferation of sessions while maintaining a comprehensive approach to all aspects under consideration by the ADP. Co-Chairs, AILAC is willing to collaborate with all colleagues and to continue our work, under their guidance, to reach ambitious consensus as soon as possible. We fully trust you to guide us through this endeavor, you have our full support to move forward decisively. We hope that this is the spirit in which our partners in this negotiation have come to Lima, to lay the foundations that will allow us to achieve progressive and concrete milestones over the next year so that at COP 21 in Paris, the Protocol to be adopted by us strengthen the climate change regime to make it long-lasting and ambitious, so climate change.

              "       ['103,2,7,7,20141202,aosis,\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, coalition of 44 island and low lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. At the outset, let me thank you for your hard work and assure you of our full trust and confidence in your leadership here in Lima. We begin this meeting on the heels of important announcements about emissions reductions from the world\\'s largest emitters, as well as long-awaited pledges to the Green Climate Fund. The news provides important momentum at a critical juncture in these negotiations. But, as the nations on the front lines of the climate crisis, and ones who are already suffering severe impacts, we start these negotiations with the somber knowledge that the progress is not nearly enough and that the decisions we make here and on the road to Paris will determine whether or not the international community takes the bold action required to ensure the survival of all our members. Still, there is no time to despair. Study after study has shown that it not too late to avert the worst impacts of climate change, but we must take action immediately and that begins with all of us here today. In order to keep global temperatures from exceeding 2 degrees C (to say nothing of the 1.5 degree threshold called for by our group) emissions must come down as soon as possible and well before 2020. We think that the discussion on near-term mitigation, under Workstream 2 of the ADP, is our best opportunity to meet this imperative and it is an absolute priority for our group. Already, we have seen very constructive and solutions-oriented discussions in key areas. The UNFCCC and Convention provide an important platform for exchanges between policy experts and practitioners, as well as for strengthening initiatives in areas with high mitigation potential, but providing technical information to parties is only the first step. Translating this progress into real action on the ground will requiring linking It to the ongoing political process and we see important opportunities where the COP can capture information from WS2 and give it higher visibility. For example, there should be high-level events at COPs, where countries are able to provide updates and discuss national and multilateral activities they are taking to enhance mitigation effort. The ADP Ministerial here Lima should be the first of these events and it will allow countries to inform the UNFCCC of action partnerships established, such as the ones announced at the very successful SIDS Conference in Samoa in September There is also a need for political discussions on paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. It is incumbent on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change by raising the ambition of their 2020 commitments, and ratifying the Doha Amendment to Kyoto Protocol. In addition, we must fully implement the agreed outcome of the Bali Action Plan, particularly through immediate action by developed countries to enhance the delivery of finance, technology transfer and development, and capacity building. Co-Chairs, Tackling climate change is an urgent but long-term effort and the international community must work diligently to ensure that we reach a meaningful agreement next year in Paris, under Workstream 1 of the ADP. We are already at the brink of one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels with accompanying impacts far more severe than what scientists predicted just a few years ago. Therefore, the discussions on adaptation are absolutely critical in moving forward. For us, adaptation is about survival. lamentably, we are also already experiencing impacts that can no longer be mitigated and to which we can no longer adapt to. Thus, loss and Damage must be included as a central element of the 2015 agreement-one that is distinct and separate from adaptation. The loss and Damage mechanism should have technical and financial functions to support vulnerable SIDS and LDCs in addressing the direct impacts of climate change with a governance body that includes representation of SIDS. We look forward to discussing this more fully. It is essential that we also make significant progress on the nature of iNDCS. More broadly we see the need for more clarity and details is commensurate with the scale of the challenge that we are facing with the increasing impacts of climate change. in the following areas: 1. The 2015 agreement must be legally binding protocol under the Convention, applicable to all. Ambition should be in line with delivering a long-term global goal of limiting temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees and consideration of all aspects of Art. 2 of the Convention must be considered at this session. Mitigation efforts captured in the 2015 agreement must be clearly quantifiable so that we are able to aggregate the efforts of all Parties. A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the 2015 agreement; The identification of the information parties will provide when putting forward their intended nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the intended contributions towards achieving the long-term global goal and consideration all aspects of Article 2 of the Convention. Finance is a fundamental building block of the 2015 agreement, and therefore it MUST contain commitments by developed country Parties and provisions to ensure scaled-up, adequate long term, predictable, new and additional finance to support mitigation and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries. This should complement other necessary means of implementation including transfer of technology and capacity building. The new agreement should also address the gaps of the current climate finance architecture and flows, including the shortage of funding for concrete adaptation in most vulnerable countries and the barriers to access resources for those capacity-constrained countries. Both public and private flows towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development have to be scaled-up urgently and different types of financing should be used and prioritized for different activities. l assure you of our continued support as we work together, united by a sense of urgency and common purpose to do what is required. Thank you. \"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs We believe that the Lima COP is an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement, which requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention and in accordance with its principles and provisions, in order to enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and achieve its Objective as stated in Article 2. At the outset we wish to convey our appreciation to you for the documents you distributed since our last meeting. We believe that the ADP outcome in Lima should focus on the three agreed tasks from Warsaw, i.e., elaboration of the elements for a drafting negotiating text, identification of the information on INDCs and acceleration of the pre-2020 implementation. But we are concerned that there is no clarity on the relationship between the INDCs and the future agreement. We wish to reiterate again our expectation to make balanced progress on the mandate of the Durban Platform here in Lima. We believe that in order to move this process forward there need to be upfront assurances from Parties on fundamental understandings, such as on differentiation, mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. We emphasise that the elements of the 2015 agreement should give effect to the principles of equity and CBDR&RC through implementation of provisions of the Convention that reflect Parties\\' common and differentiated commitments, related to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building. Co-Chairs The BASIC countries highlight the need for enhanced ambition, noting that delivery on existing commitments in the pre-2020 period by developed country 1 Parties will contribute to the enhancement of trust and confidence that are indispensable for the successful conclusion of the 2015 agreement. We welcome the announcements made by some developed countries for the initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and call on other developed countries to do likewise as soon as possible. We also look forward to a clearer indication from developed countries of how the pledges that have been made will be realised and how the commitment of providing US$100bn will be implemented. It is our view that Parties\\' intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) must cover mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building, in line with Parties\\' respective commitments under the Convention. We are convinced that adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change, experienced both now and in the future. Adaptation is an issue which requires a global response and is as important as mitigation, and all elements in paragraph 5, decision 1/CP.17 should be treated in a balanced manner in the 2015 agreement. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) could be the basis for Parties\\' adaptation INDCs. Investment in adaptation by developing countries would represent an adaptation contribution. The 2015 agreement must establish a clear link between the actions by developing countries to contribute to effectively addressing the climate change challenge and the scale of finance, technology and capacity-building support required by them for implementation. Co-Chairs, Regarding the pre-2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. We call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and emphasise the importance of revisiting and significantly increasing ambition of QELROs in 2014 and in line with what is required by science, and comparable pledges in the same timeframe by those Annex I Parties not participating in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We note with concern that the pre-2020 ambition gaps exist not only in mitigation but also in adaptation and finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. We stress that the contribution of developing countries to mitigation efforts could be further enhanced if developed countries effectively implement and significantly increase their commitments to provide finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building support to developing countries. Finally, co-chairs, the BASIC countries look forward to a constructive session and we assure you of our support and our cooperation to ensure a productive meeting here in Lima. I thank you. \"'],\n",

Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We believe the 2015 agreement should be based on the elaboration of all 6 core elements identified in decision 1/CP.17: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building. On mitigation, the new agreement must take into account the latest scientific information with the global commitment to be set at a level that would maintain the global temperature well below an increase of 1,5C. While the agreement should be applicable to all, the principles of the Convention must be respected and leadership from developed countries must guide us in the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. The nature of nationally determined contributions to be presented by all Parties should be differentiated. The 2015 agreement must be adequately informed by the work of other subsidiary bodies under the Convention and build upon important results achieved through past COP decisions. REDD+ is therefore a central element of the 2015 agreement as defined by the Warsaw REDD+ Framework. Adequate importance must also be given to Coastal Marine Ecosystems and their potential role in adaptation and mitigation. Mr. Co-chair, full support from a broad variety of financing sources, primarily from developed country Parties must be identified and allocated to REDD+ and CMEs activities. A new marl<et based mechanism, including REDD+, must be also included in the 2015 agreement. The mitigation potential of REDD+ must be fully taken into account and captured in the pre2020 ambition track. REDD+ actions should be quantified and duly recognized as a way to reduce the emissions ambition gap before 2020. Our Coalition sees four main objectives to be achieved here in Lima at the end of these two weeks: The inclusion of REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems into the draft negotiating text, based on the supporting decisions of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework Clarification of information to be submitted along with the INDCs early next year; A successful launch of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework, as per decision 10/CP.19, and anchoring it in the new agreement; The opening of a REDD+ window in the GCF. Mr. Co-chair, in addition, as the COP President has emphasized, we need to accelerate the progress made in REDD+ by bridging the Warsaw REDD Plus Framework and the Green Climate Fund Logic Framework here in Lima. Finally Mr Co-Chair, We are looking forward to engaging with all Parties in these two weeks on the elaboration of the elements identified above. We are confident that you will assist us in the completion of this challenging task. \"'],\n",

The EIG countries have come to Lima to take substantial decisions on the climate agreement from 2020. Here in Lima, we must capture the key elements of the 2015 agreement in all relevant areas to address climate challenge: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The EIG is encouraged by the early announcements of the quantifiable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by China, the European Union, and the United States. I am also pleased to confirm, that all the EIG Parties are sincerely engaged in domestic preparations of their corresponding INDCs and are strongly committed to their timely communication ahead of COP21 as well as the accompanying up front information. The EIG is further encouraged by the very ambitious contributions to the Green Climate Fund of many Parties in the position to do so, including the EIG countries. We consider this as a very positive signal to underline that with political will the international community can come together and decide on elements that support a low emissions and resilient development pathway to our societies. The EIG has come to Lima to build on these clear indications for global action and cooperation and to send a clear signal to private sector and stakeholders that an effective, fair and legally binding agreement will be adopted in Paris next year. A key element for the 2015 agreement is differentiation. Differentiation is a tool to reflect different realities and circumstances with regard to equity, responsibility and capacity; to ensure fairness; and to stimulate ambition. The EIG takes the view, that for fair differentiation, self-determination is essential and needs to be complemented by guiding elements. Such guiding elements of differentiation and flexibility can be reflected in the 2015 agreement, COP decisions, or complementary assurances. The EIG is looking forward to engage with others on these is-sues. The EIG has further come to Lima to define the up front information to be submit-ted by all Parties together with their INDCs and on the modalities of the INDC process starting next year. The EIG countries support a multilateral process on the INDCs starting from the first quarter 2015 and accommodation all Parties and their circumstances. Such a multilateral process should be facilitative, non intrusive, non punitive where all Parties share information on the underlying effort of their INDCs and their considerations on equity, fairness and CBDR/RC regarding their INDC in view of the 2 degrees goal. Such a process will demonstrate that each Party\\'s INDC is part of a collective, global effort to combat climate change. In short: the process should allow for clarification, compilation, calibration with what is needed to achieve the 2 degrees objective, and set the basis for cooperation to close a possible gap. It will build trust in the run up to Paris and set a good basis to consider enhanced action through international cooperative initiatives. The EIG takes the view that it is important to ensure that the up front information and multilateral process assure clear, transparent and understandable mitigation commitments. Likewise, the EIG provides high relevance to action on adaptation to ensure a trasition towards a climate resilient planet. Thus, we consider that a bottom up approach may also be beneficial around adaptation commitments - however, fol-lowing different time lines, and the follow-up to the submission of national devel-opment strategies and plans would have to be adaptation type specific. The EIG therefore sees a benefit in outlining also, here in Lima, a specific bottom-up approach with regard to adaptation. As a third element, the ADP must advance international collaboration up to 2020 on the global ambition gap. Here in Lima, we must define continued robust work to identify options to enhance global mitigation ambition. We must grasp the positive signals of the UN Climate Summit and strengthen collaboration on opportunities and international initiatives. Mr Co-Chair, let me finally, thank you for the issued draft decision text as well as the non-paper on elements of the 2015 agreement. The EIG supports your approach in organizing our work and is ready to work on the basis of the issued draft texts. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chair. \"'],\n",
              "       ['107,2,7,7,20141202,eu,\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. It is essential that COP 20 delivers on three things under the ADP, building on the progress made at our last session in October, namely: (i) a decision that addresses INDCs, including in particular up front information and the pre COP 21 international process to consider and analyse them; (ii) a decision that further enhances global mitigation ambition before 2020; and (iii) agreement on draft elements of a negotiating text of the 2015 Agreement. In relation to the draft ADP decision we welcome the initiative of co-Chairs to prepare the revised version prepared by the co-Chairs on the basis of inputs of Parties. We look forward to textual negotiations and improvements to that text here in Lima. In relation to the draft elements of a negotiating text we also welcome to the initiative of co-Chairs 10 prepare the revised non-paper. We underline the importance we attach to elements such as such as the rules base, including MRV, accounting, the cycle of ambition and compliance in relation to mitigation. These central issues did not get their fair share of time at our sixth session in Bonn, and must be addressed here in Lima in addition to adaptation and finance. The discussions that took place in Bonn on adaptation are the kind of exchanges that we need to see on all key issues in relation to the 2015 Agreement. We really have very little time left for a more focused negotiating text to be made available. In October EU leaders endorsed the 2030 climate and energy framework, with a binding headline domestic greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990. The US and China followed by making important announcements in relation to their post 2020 mitigation targets. We look forward to these being translated into transparent, quantifiable and comparable INDCs in the coming 4 months, and for at least all major and emerging economies to come forward with theirs. The EU is already working on its INDC on the basis of information requirements common to the current draft decision annex options such as base year, type of contribution, timeframe, coverage, and methodologies and assumptions. The decision agreed in Lima must allow us all to be on the same page in terms of what is needed. We also note the significant initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund as a result of contributions by EU Member States amounting to more than $3.9 billion as well as contributions by several others, including some developing countries. It is essential that we build on the positive momentum of these recent developments, as well as the UN Secretary General Summit of World Leaders, to secure a good outcome in Lima. In closing we continue to look to the co-Chairs for their guidance and to work with our negotiating partners and the Peruvian COP Presidency in a spirit of constructive engagement. \"'],\n",
              "       ['108,2,7,7,20141202,g77china,\"I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China Mr. Co-Chairs, The objectives of the ADP session in Lima are very clear in accordance with the agreed task from the Warsaw decision and previous decisions. They are, first, the elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text; second, the identification of the information to be provided by Parties when communicating their Intended Nationally Determined Communications, and third, the acceleration of pre-2020 implementation. The decision in Lima must reflect balanced progress in both workstreams, as well as between workstreams. We need to focus on these three core agreed tasks to ensure a successful COP in Lima and to lay a solid foundation for the adoption of the agreement in Paris next year. The Group underlines the importance of making substantial progress on elaboration of the elements for a drafting negotiating text, essential to the adoption of the 2015 agreement in Paris. The Group reiterates that the 2015 agreement must be under the Convention and based on its principles and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The provisions of the 2015 agreement should focus on enhanced action related to the six core elements. Mr. Co-Chairs, The Group also looks forward to advance negotiations on the information of the intended nationally determined contributions. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions represent the effort each country is willing to make in the global effort to fight climate change, and must be seen in a balanced and comprehensive context pursuant to decisions 1/CP.17, 2/CP.18 and 1/CP.19 in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Developed country Parties shall provide finance, technology transfer and capacity building support. Developing countries will require provision of adequate support for their domestic preparations of their intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon, as well as for the implementation of their enhanced action both before and after 2020. The Group would like to reiterate that decision 1/CP.19 paragraph 2(d) urges developed countries, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other organizations to provide adequate support to allow for developing countries to undertake their domestic preparations for the intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon, and for implementing their enhanced action after 2020. It is crucial to provide clarity on the level of financial support that will be provided by developed country Parties to developing country Parties to allow for enhanced implementation of the Convention. Any agreement without Equity and CBDR and RC is not in accordance with the Convention. A protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force that is only mitigation focused and bottom-up will result in developed countries emitting more than they should within a global emission budget to limit warming in this century and will not effectively , address climate change as early as possible. Time is running out - the world cannot afford half-measures or half-commitments with respect to climate actions. The relevant part of the Lima decision should \\' focus on identification of the information, in order to achieve a successful outcome on the information with a view to facilitating the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDCs. Mr. Co-Chairs, Workstream II is an integral part of the ADP and has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. Enhanced pre-2020 ambition will not only provide a strong basis for post-2020 cooperation, but is also necessary to avoid higher costs and risks associated with adaptation and mitigation in the long run. Through WSII, all countries should demonstrate . their political will recognizing that developed countries shall take the lead through enhanced actions on increasing the emission reduction targets to at least 40% by 2020 below 1990 level and providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing country Parties, which, in turn, contributes to greater confidence and trust among Parties in the context of negotiations on the Durban Platform. The work of workstream II should continue until the pre2020 ambition gap is closed. The follow-up arrangements on accelerating the implementation of paragraph 3, 4 and 5 of the Warsaw decision are integral parts of the workplan under WSII. Both the accelerated implementation of paragraph 3 and 4 of the Warsaw Decision and the technical expert meetings should be dealt with in the draft decision in a balanced manner and as a matter of urgency and priority. Mr. Co-Chairs, The group wishes to express its full support toward helping the Co-Chairs secure a successful outcome to these negotiations. In this regard, the group believes that the most promising way forward lies in ensuring that the 2015 agreement treats the elements. of mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building and transparency of action and support in a balanced manner. The group also reiterates the need to secure progress in addressing the issues of Loss and Damage as well as Adverse Impacts of Response Measures in an effective and meaningful manner. We would like to emphasize the importance of all elements of Article 6 of the Convention, which are fundamental for the effective implementation of a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force. Developing skills for new and sustainable jobs, engaging all groups of society, communicating climate science and sharing information on climate change effectively, benefitting from traditional knowledge and indigenous practices for innovative climate action and fostering an informed citizenry are essential aspects for success of such a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force. The Group would like to recall that the objective of the ADP is to enhance action and to promote the full and effective implementation of the Convention through the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime. Any attempts to redefine, rewrite, renegotiate or reinterpret the Convention and its principles and provisions that would result in a watering down or weakening of the Convention will not be acceptable and will only complicate and delay the process. Mr. Co-Chairs, As you yourselves have pointed out, time is not on our side. The G77 and China is concerned about the lack of progress in elaborating the elements , 5 of the 2015 agreement. The work on the text of the elements must be accelerated. This can be accomplished by adopting a mode of work that reflects the principles and provisions of the Convention, focuses on the specific points under the six core elements in a balanced manner and by further fleshing out the elements through Party-driven, targeted and focused negotiations The group is also of the view that trust and confidence can be enhanced by establishing a balance in the progress of discussions of the elements and the information on INDCs. There also needs to be a balance in the treatment of Parties inputs as reflected in neutral, balanced and comprehensive outcome documents. Any streamlining of the options should be based on the consensus among the Parties collectively and constructively, by reflecting Parties\\' views in a comprehensive manner. In closing, Mr. Co-Chairs, The G77 and China envisions a mode of work that builds on areas of commonality, that has a high probability of achieving a meaningful outcome, and that reflects the consensus and ownership by all Parties. The group stands ready to work with you and with our negotiating partners to secure this desired outcome here in Lima as a prelude to the successful completion of our work in Paris next year. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"'],\n",
              "       ['109,2,7,7,20141202,ldc,\"Co-chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the LDC Group. I would like to associate my statement with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of the African Group and by Nauru on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). Co-chairs, I will address the elements related to both contect and process in my intervention. As indicated by the 5th assessment report of the IPCC, greenhouse gas emissions concentrations in the atmosphere arc now the highest, they have ever been, and are continuing to rise. We have reached a point where we are already experiencing impacts that cannot be reversed. Mr. Co-chairs, is this context, a successful climate deal in Paris must engage Parties in Lima working towards the adoption of a protocol, with most ambitious emission reduction targets, that addresses adaptation, Loss and Damage, means of implantation, transparency of action and support. A successful Protocol in Paris must strengthen our ability as a global community to cope with the inevitable changes we now face, providing in particular effective financial, technical and capacity building support to the most vulnerable countries to cope with climate impacts. We have contributed least to this crisis. Yet we are suffering worst and will continue to do so. We propose followings to be addressed in priorities in Lima: First, we thank you for the second version of The non-paper and we support your approach for this session to have a more in-depth textual negotiation. the non-paper as it stands is reasonably well balanced. We are grateful that you have picked up most of the elements that we proposed in our October submission and we are optimistic that the rest will be accommodated as well. We hope to further define the elements text and formalize it here in Lima. Second, we feel the draft decision on INDC and Pre-2020 ambition needs more clarity. The decision related to INDC must enable the parties to provide information when putting their INDCs forward in the context of the 2015 Protocol. This decision should facilitate parties for domestic preparations, including the information Parties require to submit in their contributions by March 2015 in a transparent and quantifiable manner. It is important that the INDC decision also provides clear provisions to enable upwards adjustments of initial contributions in line with science, so that we can secure a Protocol that ensures the survival of our countries. All Parties must have mitigation components in their INDCs. However, the national circumstances and special needs of LDCs and SIDS will be reflected in their INDCs. Third, we need to focus our discussion on how to accelerate the implementation of pre-2020 climate action, including ratifying the Doha Amendments of the Kyoto Protocol. 1\\'hose countries that must deliver the highest mitigation actions, aiming at closing the mitigation gap, must act fast based on science and to avoid further impacts, Loss and Damage due to climate change. With respect to the process, we are generally comfortable with the approach you have set out. Finally Mr Co-Chairs, we reaffirm that the LDC Group is strongly committed to this process. We believe that we can have successful negotiations in Lima under your strong leadership. Thank you \"'],\n",
              "       ['110,2,7,7,20141202,lmdc,\"Cuba is delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. We fully associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, both the process in the ADP and the substance of what we produce at this session are going to be crucial in shaping what the final outcome will be in Paris. We are deeply concerned about the process within the ADP. Direct negotiations among the Parties did not take place at the October session, and your scenario note indicates that that will also not be the case at this session. We are highly concerned that this process will not move us forward in a Party-driven, transparent and inclusive manner. We expect the mode of work to change from the very first day. We expect to see the Contact Group start direct and interactive negotiations among the Parties. We want to see draft texts from Parties on screen, on paper, being directly negotiated by the Parties with each other through focused negotiating groups around specific points under the six core elements in order to narrow differences, find convergence, and achieve consensus. Various views from Parties should be reflected in a balanced, objective, neutral and comprehensive manner. Any streamlining of the options should be based on the collectively constructed consensus among Parties rather than reflecting Parties\\' views in a selective manner We do not want to lose more time. We expect, at the close of this session, to see the elements for a draft negotiating text to have been elaborated by the ADP. This is our mandate and must be fulfilled. We want to see a solid and robust international outcome implementing the UNFCCC\\'s provisions, principles, and structure. This will enable all countries to solve the climate crisis together in an equitable manner. This international cooperation should see developed countries doing substantially more than what they are doing or planning to do in cutting their emissions. We should also see developed countries fulfill their commitments under the UNFCCC and cooperate more with developing countries, through providing more financial resources, improving access to climate knowledge and technology, helping build skills and capacity, and addressing the adverse social and economics consequences of their response measures, so that developing countries would be able to do more in terms of adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable development as their respective contributions to addressing climate change in a manner that benefits all countries and peoples equitably. The ADP decision in Lima should address balance in the core elements mandated by Durban and focus on the three agreed tasks from Warsaw, i.e., elaboration of the elements, identification of the information and acceleration of the pre-2020 implementation. We emphasize our grave concern over those developed country Parties that are not Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, or do not participate in the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We believe that any attempts by developed country Parties to 1 casually set aside their existing legal commitments while calling for increasing pre-2020 ambition or a new legal agreement seriously questions their sincerity in combating climate change. Unfortunately, your draft ADP decision text falls far short in terms of being balanced and comprehensive. The bottom-up approach based on self-differentiation for all Parties, as proposed by the developed country Parties will not reflect the principle of CBDR, would fail to achieve ambitious and urgent commitments, and represents a clear backsliding on their existing commitments under the Convention. It prioritizes mitigation over all the other elements such as adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building. It paves the way to an outcome that will in essence rewrite and reinterpret the Convention, particularly the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and will eliminate the differentiation between developed and developing country Patties. It downplays the high importance that developing countries attach to seeing adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building be on an equal footing as mitigation and as the basis for their enhanced actions in the 2015 outcome. The same approach can be seen in your non-paper on the elements. This approach will lead to an outcome marked by low ambition and low levels of action. It will be inequitable, unbalanced, and will not bring us closer to solving the climate crisis in a fair manner. For your papers to be considered as among the bases for our negotiations, balance must be first brought into them. This would include, among other things: treating all elements in a balanced manner and with the equal footing , rather than prioritizing mitigation over the others; ensuring that the principle of CBDR as seen in the Convention is fully reflected rather than reinterpreted or rewritten through using the terms \\'evolving\\'; the bottom-up approach can not be the new approach for undertaking commitments by developed country Parties but should be so for the enhanced actions to be undertaken by developing countries; developed countries must substantially ramp up their emission reductions ambition; and the linkage between the provision by developed countries of the finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries and what developing countries can do in terms of enhanced actions must be made clear. We want to reach an outcome here in Lima and then in Paris that will be equitable and allows us all to work together to solve the climate crisis. We can only do that if the process is open and transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and built on consensus if the substantive content is balanced. As representatives of sovereign States, we wish to negotiate with our partners with dignity and respect in order to achieve consensus. We will not accept being made, due to a mismanaged process, to press around each other in an undemocratic, non-inclusive, and nontransparent \"\"huddle\"\" at the last hours and minutes of the COP just to finalize a decision. We will not accept a situation in which we are forced to consider on a take it or leave it basis an outcome text that we have not negotiated upon, whether in Lima or Paris. This is our responsibility as the representatives of our 3.5 billion peoples. Thank you. \"'],\n",

SICA aligns itself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Our region is strongly committed to the achievement of concrete results in the ADP here in Lima and on the road to Paris with the view to fulfill the mandate of the Durban Platform for enhanced Action. SICA members consider that now is the time to move into an open, transparent and inclusive negotiating and focused format among parties. Given the interest we as Governments and our people worldwide have in the success of this process, we must avoid the huddle process which has come to characterize previous COPs. We need to act with urgency to deliver upon the mandate of the ADP. SICA wishes to signal our expectations for the ADP decisions in Lima. Overview SICA calls on all Parties to work constructively on all the elements for a balanced draft negotiating text and the work regarding information on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions as well as on the work-plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to achieve the 1.5 degree and help close the pre-2020 ambition gap, particularly by developed countries. Revised JF As an overarching consideration, SICA Member States underscore the centrality of the principles and provisions of the Convention, including, equity and Common but Differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and the most recent scientific evidence, in the I PCC fifth Assessment Synthesis Report in the execution of the ADP mandate. These are the foundation upon which we should elaborate an ambitious, durable and effective agreement that will promote the participation of all parties in the fulfillment of the ultimate objective of the Convention. Expectations for the 2015 Agreement Within that agreement, SICA Member States underscore that adaptation needs to be strengthened and the Adaptation Committee should be anchored therein. All the six elements identified in the ADP mandate should be reflected in a balanced and meaningful way in the agreement, including the transparency of action and support. We also wish to underscore the importance of all elements of Article 6, which are fundamental for the effective implementation of the 2015 agreement, including developing skills for new and sustainable jobs, engaging all groups of society, communicating climate science and sharing information on climate change effectively, benefiting from traditional knowledge and indigenous practices for innovative climate actions effectively. Expectations for INDCs With respect to INDCs, we stress the need to include all the elements of the ADP mandate. Further, we consider that the required information to be submitted should be based on the provisions of the convention and relevant decisions and may have different modalities as per the national circumstances and capacities on different issues. Expectations for Finance On finance, we must have clear commitments, and clarity on how scaling up the mobilization of 100 billion USO per year by 2020 to assist 2 Revised JF developing countries in both adaption and mitigation is going to be accomplished. Expectations on process Finally, given that we have decided that the ADP is intended to produce a protocol, other legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force, we must initiate discussions on the issues that would arise from a legally binding agreement that includes the legal implications of the different elements. We support the call for consideration of the establishment a mechanism at the proper time that will consider legal aspects of such an agreement that have yet to be addressed.

Umbrella Group countries are determined to successfully adopt an ambitious new global climate change agreement, applicable to all, in Paris. We are committed to implementing our commitments up to 2020. We will also explore cooperative ways to enhance practical climate action, including by working with business, civil society and others. We recognise the significance of this meeting in paving the way for success in Paris. Here in Lima, we must deliver a COP decision that provides the clear guidance countries need to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions toward mitigating climate change well in advance of Paris. Transparent, understandable and quantifiable emission reduction efforts are critical to building collective confidence and understanding how we are tracking globally. We must have guidance on this ahead of the agreed timetable for tabling iNDCs. Here in Lima, we must also further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text. Elements that are balanced, concise and based on areas of convergence will serve as a guide when we move into formal negotiations on the agreement text next year. Significant work will be needed to achieve this. Umbrella Group countries will be offering our suggestions on how to bring the current version of your non-paper in line with these objectives. We recognise the political priority for the Paris agreement to address mitigation, adaptation and support. But doing so will require addressing each issue according to its unique characteristics, while ensuring that the agreement remains focused on enhancing mitigation ambition and achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention. Umbrella Group countries also emphasise the importance of developing a common transparency and accountability framework to support the agreement, including rules for the land sector and markets. We must keep an overall view of the structure of the agreement, and identify which elements will need to be constant and durable, and which are dynamic and therefore are better dealt with through evolving decisions. For this reason, it is essential that we do not splinter our discussions into fragmented workstreams, but ensure our mode of work lets us bring the structure and form of the elements non-papear together in a coherent way. Here in Lima, we want to have periodic opportunities to come together as a group between parallel elements discussions for this reason. Co-Chairs, The ADP has done important practical work over the last year on enhancing pre2020 mitigation ambition. The value of the technical meetings has been widely acknowledged, as has the value of a cooperative approach that involves a broad set of actors from international and regional organisations, sub-national entities and the private sector. Umbrella Group countries strongly support this work and want to see it continue. Here in Lima, we seek a decision that will do just that. We do not see it being helpful to shift the focus of this workstream from cooperative collaboration, towards an implementation review that duplicates processes already happening elsewhere under the UNFCCC. Co-Chairs, There is much to do. And we are ever mindful of how short our time is. We are confident in your leadership, and assure you, and all Parties, of our commitment to securing strong ADP outcomes here in Lima. \"'],\n",

We had a few key points that are essential for us (red lines). Unfortunately we find that the new text does not address any of our key points adequately. This includes affirming that this text is operating under the principles of the Convention especially equity and CBDR, differentiation between Annex 1 and non Annex 1 in INDCs is recognised and operationalised, no introduction of new terms such as \\x1cother parties in a position to do so\\x1d or \\x1cwilling to do so\\x1d, which undermines the differentiation, and which are not terms or concepts agreed in the Convention, The scope of the INDCs includes all the elements\\x14mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology, capacity building, transparency. It should not be mitigation centric. In particular, there has to be parallel information on finance contributions which is required to support the developing countries\\x19 contributions on mitigation and other climate actions, the contents of the Decision will not prejudge the terms and content of the 2015 agreement. There should not be activities on assessment of the INDCs in 2015 (ex ante assessment) and a process of assessment can be considered after 2015 on terms to be agreed to. In the process to build the negotiating text for the 2015 agreement, the submissions of Parties are crucial components that will be drawn on. We have provided a lot of ideas and then a lot of textual language on the above as well as other points. However we are disappointed that our points are not taken on board in the new text. For example: The CBDR and other principles of Convention are not adequately recognised and especially not operationalised. There is no recognition of CBDR or differentiation relating to INDCs and information to be submitted on INDCs. Terms such as ??other countries willing to do so?? are introduced. The finance issue is inadequately treated in the text with no requirement for developed countries to provide information on their finance contributions. The text is mitigation centric. The draft Decision is pre-judging the core elements of the Paris agreement. This is because of the above factors, including the absence of differentiation, the establishment of a mandatory system of mitigation in the text, and the lack of finance commitment in the text. There are activities on assessment in 2015, such as a workshop and Secretariat paper. Para 4 elevates the co chairs?? elements non paper to be the basis of continuing the work on elements, even though it has no legal status, and there has been little discussion on it, while the views and submissions of Parties are not mentioned.

              "       ['114,2,8,8,20150208,ag,\"Co-chairs, The Republic of the Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. The African Group associates itself with the statement made by the Republic of South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Let me at the outset congratulate you for your election and reiterate the Group\\x19s full support to a successful completion of your mandate. The Group also likes to thank the Government of Switzerland for hosting the meeting in the beautiful city of Geneva, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for the good arrangements made. Co-chairs, Time is running out in producing a draft negotiation text before May 2015, as agreed in Lima. The next 6 days shall be our unique opportunity to advance our work the Group makes the following comments: 3 on the organization of work and 6 on the Substance of the Draft Element Text: On Organization of Work FIRST: In streamlining, parties shall have the flexibility to draw from their own positions and not exclusively the draft element text. However, Co-chairs, as custodians of the Text and process, be aware that insertions and proposals explicitly contradicting either in spirit, or literally, any fundamental principles or provision of the Convention such as Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) in Article 4 and Equity in Article 3, as this would only delay and protract our work and not lead us to any constructive engagement. The Africa group believe that the ADP negotiations are aimed at achieving an agreement with legal force that strength the current multilateral rules-based regime. Therefore our work should be under and guided by the principles and provisions of the Convention and all elements should be treated in a balancer manner. SECOND: In the formation of focused groups and the identification of their mandate, a transparent selection of facilitators in contact with their respective sub-groups is warranted. In addition an inclusive approach to the participation of the focused groups should be followed. Also clarity on the work and the outcomes to the extent possible should be made. Finally the identification of elements to be either included in the Draft Negotiation text or complementary decisions at this point should be cautioned as this might distract us from our mandate of producing a Draft Negotiation by end of next week. THIRD: On scheduling ? Co-Chairs \\x13 We call on you : To explore possibilities of ending the meetings at 6 pm to allow time for Group\\x19s coordination meetings, and; To Ensure that the text to be taken forward is circulated to all parties well before the end of the meeting to allow for the parties endorsement Co-chairs, On points of Substance FIRST: addressing adaptation is not only a sovereign responsibility but a global obligation as well. Legal obligations are established in Convention Articles 2 and 4, in particular articles 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9. A fair outcome for Africa is a meaningful reflection of adaptation support commitments from developed countries. It is a fact that 2degree warming will already pose grave risks to agricultural production and other livelihoods systems across the African continent, putting lives of people at risk, and will require significant adaptation efforts. As part of the elements of the agreement we expect the inclusion of temperature goal, associated emission reduction goals, adaptation goal, with its associated finance and technology support. The global goal for adaptation is a mechanism to recognize the global responsibility and obligatory nature of adaptation to the international community. Loss and damage represents impacts of climate change that are not addressed by mitigation and adaptation and which require a different set of tools to address and should therefore be given its own section in the agreement. The Warsaw international mechanism should be anchored in the new agreement and fully operationalised to ensure that developing countries are provided with support ? including finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building to address loss and damage. SECOND: On Finance - the Paris Agreement should deal with the current gaps and ensure the full inclusion of the following elements: Clear principles that guides the provisions of finance from developed countries to developing countries, in line with the responsibilities clearly identified under the Convention and other relevant decisions (2) Clear quantified targets that link the level of support to the temperature target and stresses on the linkage of actions of developing countries and support provided to them and in line with their needs a\"\" identified by them, with a process to regularly review and update the level of support to be provided to developing countries.

Allow me to begin by associating ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chair, AILAC warmly welcomes and congratulates you on your appointment as the new ADP Co-Chair. We trust that you will draw upon your extensive and esteemed experience to guide our discussions during this crucial year of the negotiations. AILAC would like to congratulate the Peruvian presidency for the advances made in Lima under their leadership. At COP20 we achieved all tasks that had been set out for us, specifically: We acknowledged the progress made in elaborating the elements for a draft negotiating text that are annexed to decision 1/CP.20. By doing so, Lima succeeded in setting us on track for an ambitious Paris Agreement this year, by providing us with this elaborate basis for our negotiations; We identified the information for parties to provide when communicating their intended nationally determined contributions, in order to provide transparency, clarity and understanding, a critical step to be able to aggregate the contributions and assess our global efforts to reach the 2-degree goal; In Lima we also decided on the continuation of our work on enhancing pre-?\\x102020 mitigation ambition under workstream 2 beyond 2015; which needs to play a significant role in closing the 8-?\\x1010 Gt CO2e emissions gap that remains between emissions levels consistent with the 2-degree target and expected emissions levels if existing pledges are implemented. The GCF\\x19s initial capitalization reached over USD 10 billion; with groundbreaking participation from a number of members of AILAC. These are remarkable achievements that must be highlighted. Yet, much remains to be done in order to reach our common goal of having an ambitious, effective and robust 2015 Agreement in Paris. Time is pressing and we need to start without delay here in Geneva to continue our negotiations on the elements that AILAC considers to be priorities, such as the giving political parity to adaptation, establishing clear rules for mitigation, scaling up of finance for climate action, and the design of a durable architecture for commitment cycles. Co-Chair, It is AILAC\\x19s belief that it can be of benefit to our negotiations if we can agree at this ADP session to a clear and transparent method for streamlining the texts we are collectively working on. We are grateful for the Scenario Note produced by the Co-Chair, which fosters transparency, inclusiveness and openness to input from the Parties. It is also important to learn from our recent experience, and immediately start work on the basis of the annex of the Lima Call for Climate Action, with focused negotiations under the ADP contact group. We believe it is critically important that the 2015 Agreement address in a balanced manner mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The Agreement should include collective goals on these three issues, in order to provide a shared sense of direction to our global efforts to enhance climate change actions.

I speak on behalf of the following members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) Cuba, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. We join the interventions made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and Bolivia by the Group of Like-Thinking Developing Countries (LMDC). Our countries have been committed at the highest level of Government to reach a just and necessary agreement to save Mother Earth, and therefore they wish to make the following points: Since the Copenhagen Conference we have added our voices to that of the peoples of the world regarding the need not to change the climate, but to change the unjust system that promotes unsustainable models of production and consumption, the excessive accumulation of capital, the exhaustion of natural resources beyond the biophysical limits of the planet. It does not stop us worrying that it has been precisely developed countries that have demonstrated an alarming level of non-compliance and ignorance of their obligations not only of mitigation, but also in the provision of financing, technology transfer and capacity to developing countries, in the current legal climate change regime, which makes it difficult for us to start this process with overly optimistic expectations. It is necessary to raise the moral level of the debate to achieve the ambition that the world requires to overcome the systemic crises in which we find ourselves immersed. Ethical action is essential just 10 months after the Paris Conference. It is irrational and unfair to try to impose that developing countries are the ones that should cover the default quotas of those countries with historical responsibilities in origin and acceleration of this problem. The right to sustainable development should not be curtailed to our peoples, who are the ones who suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, and the right is the responsibility of all countries to achieve the eradication of poverty, in all its dimensions. The future agreement may not be based on the continuation of false promises or false solutions that reissue the causes that have generated the problem. Ladies and Gentlemen Co-Presidents, it is necessary to guarantee an inclusive and transparent process of negotiations, led by the States, for the well-being of the process that will take us to Paris. Ways should be found for the negotiating text to reflect the views of the Parties in an equitable and balanced way based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Negotiations must make it possible to strengthen the current commitments of the Kyoto Protocol and achieve in Paris to complement and improve the climate regime with an ambitious agreement based on the Convention, its principles and objectives. \"'],\n",

I would like to associate with the statement delivered by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chair, At the outset, let me thank you for taking on this challenging task in what is a critical year in the international effort to address climate change. In the past few weeks alone, scientists have confirmed that 2014 was the hottest year on record and that sea level rise is accelerating more drastically than previously believed\\x14underscoring the urgency of the challenge before us, particularly for our members, whose very survival is at stake. Needless to say, it is absolutely essential that we make substantive progress this week and that we avoid squandering our limited time on procedural matters. Co-Chair, We are prepared to progress our discussions based on the elements for a draft negotiating text contained in the Annex of the Lima decision. Building trust towards Paris will require that there are no surprises in our mode of work or the outputs of our negotiations. In this regard, we welcome your assurances that the negotiating text will be drafted in an open and transparent manner and will reflect the contributions of all parties. We also welcome your assurance that parties will have the opportunity to review the manner in which our inputs have been captured before this session in Geneva is closed as well as the opportunity to further engage on the negotiating text and the issues raised at subsequent sessions.

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs At the outset we wish to convey our congratulations for your appointment as ADP cochairs and express our support to you in the extremely important task of guiding Parties towards consensus. We believe that the Lima COP has been an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement, by providing us with the elements for a draft negotiating text and agreeing on information to be presented along with the intended nationally determined contributions. The \\x18Lima Call for Climate Action\\x19 clearly underlines that the 2015 outcome should be under the Convention and be guided by its principles and provisions. The elements for a draft negotiating text provide a good starting point for this year. We express our strong desire to make further progress during this session, by making balanced progress both between the two work streams and among the six mandated elements of the 2015 agreement under the Durban Platform. The BASIC countries believe that achieving consensus requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention, in full accordance with its principles and provisions. The Paris agreement should enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, not create a new regime or restructure, reinterpret or rewrite the Convention. Co-Chairs We have before us the complex task of translating the elements text into a draft negotiating text before May 2015. The ADP should immediately enter a real negotiation that is open and transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensusbuilding. In order to do so, it is the view of the group that we must advance on the elements mandated in Durban, in a balanced manner and coherent structure. Coherence is also fundamental to address cross-cutting issues in all sections of the negotiating text, in particular differentiation between developed and developing countries and the application of the principles of equity and CBDR &RC. In this regard, BASIC countries would like to underline our view that the so-called ??self differentiation?? approach is not consistent with the Convention, nor with the Durban mandate or the Lima Call for Climate Action. The 2015 agreement is a vehicle to enhance the implementation of commitments in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention. This requires honoring and implementing existing commitments and responsibilities by developed countries. Enhanced action will not be achieved by shifting these to developing countries. Co-Chairs, Regarding the pre-2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition and call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period. We note with concern that the pre-2020 ambition ga\"'],\n",

We associate this statement with those delivered on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, and on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, we congratulate you on your election and thank you for undertaking the task of leading us to the finalization of a comprehensive and ambitious international legally binding agreement applicable to all. The agreement\\x19s ambition must be largely science-driven; and, as such, it must be commensurate with the evidence of the growing magnitude of the adverse impacts of climate change and the increasing potential of dangerous climate change. As we have contended since the inception of this process, the adequacy of the global response should be measured against the benchmark of what is needed to ensure the survival of small island and low-lying developing states. We therefore insist upon a holistic approach in the agreement that : Defines what we shall undertake in order to contain global warming to as far as possible below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; Provides for comprehensive action, including the establishment or strengthening of effective mechanisms, to meet adaptation needs especially of the SIDS; Anchors the commitment to effectively address Loss and Damage as a specific objective in the agreement; Provides for the anchoring and implementation of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework; and, Articulates concrete commitments to achieve the adequate scale, additionality, predictability and transparency for sustained climate finance and to make readily available technology and capacity building to support the full and effective implementation of the agreement as a whole, taking into account, at the same time, the particular challenges SIDS face in accessing finance and technology. A critical preliminary step to advancing this approach is the submission of iNDCs so that an assessment can be made to evaluate the effect of all the pledges to limit global warming, as well as the potential related consequences for adaptation. CARICOM is committed to working to meet the deadline for these submissions. We welcome your initiative to convene a session on support available for preparation of INDCs. Because of the slow response of the climate system to emissions, and the need to undertake reassessments of the mitigation efforts, we consider that the pledging cycles should be no longer than five years. The world should not tie itself down to a target that condemns our most vulnerable countries to permanent loss and damage and possibly extinction. Co-chairs, we appreciate the indicative schedule you have provided us but wish to draw your attention to two issues. You have included Loss and Damage as an appendage to Adaptation. These are separate issues and require, likewise, separate treatment. We therefore request the setting aside of time to consider Loss and Damage as a stand-alone issue. Secondly, we must address legal form and welcome dedicating at least an evening session for this purpose. We maintain, as do many othe\"'],\n",

We thank them for their leadership and guidance, which we believe set us on the right path to achieve an agreement in Paris. We are sure that you will be able to keep the bar high and lead us toward a successful outcome in Paris at the end of the year. Mr. Co-chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chair our Coalition came to Lima well prepared and determined to move the process forward and build on the success of previous years. In particular, we all recognize the vital role rainforests play related to both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C will be unfulfilled without the contribution of rainforests. This concept is not fully nor properly reflected in the draft negotiating text that was issued at COP-20 in Lima. After the successful adoption of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework in 2013, rainforest nations are now ready to implement REDD+ actions on the ground. This is strictly conditional upon adequate and predictable financial and technological support and capacity building. Mr. Co-Chair, with respect to REDD+ finance, we believe that a new market-based mechanism including REDD+ should be established. We must also acknowledge the necessity for an operational link between the REDD Plus logical framework of the Green Climate Fund and the Warsaw Framework for REDD+. Support for REDD+ actions to developing countries provided under and outside the Convention should be properly coordinated following the guidance provided by the Annual Meeting of REDD+ national entities as per decision 10/CP.19.

This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland.  We would first like to thank the Peruvian presidency for the excellent manner, in which they conducted the conference in Lima in December and would like to express our support to the incoming French presidency for the months to come and a successful outcome of the COP in Paris.  Mr. Co-chairs, we all know, how important this year is. The outcome of Paris needs to be a legally binding instrument containing the enduring elements of the 2015 Agreement, COP decisions with dynamic and technical elements, and NDCs for the period from 2020. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement needs to address all relevant areas: mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency of action and support. We hope to leave Geneva with not only a negotiation text that is acceptable as a basis for the further negotiations by all but also a text which is further streamlined and makes clear which elements should be addressed in the agreement and which in COP decisions.  In our view, Parties already had the chance in Lima to propose text they want to see reflected in the paper. We are happy to see the proposals made in Lima in the text but are of the view, that here in Geneva we need to start shortening and streamlining the text.  In the area of Mitigation, we need to ensure that in Paris we will be able to anchor fair and ambitious NDCs. In Warsaw and Lima, Parties have agreed to prepare INDCs and communicate them well in advance of COP21 and by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so, including up-front information. I like to reiterate here, that all EIG Parties are sincerely engaged in domestic preparations of their INDCs and are strongly committed to their timely communication ahead of COP21 including the accompanying up-front 2 information as decided in Lima. We would welcome the possibility that Parties that have submitted their INDCs before June would have the opportunity, if they wish to do so, to present them and receive reactions from other country Parties in the spirit of learning and mutual understanding.  Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement must be based on one common set of rules applicable to all Parties but at different depths in terms of type, stringency and timing among other in order to account for different national circumstances and capacities. Such a rules based system is of utmost importance in order to ensure transparency, comparability and mutual understanding.  Adaptation must be a major component of the 2015 Agreement and should be addressed with the same level of priority. In our view, the development and implementation of adaptation plans and strategies is central in order to build resilience and minimize and cope with the adverse effects of climate change. For means of implementation, the new agreement needs to ensure that all developed country Parties and other Parties in a position to do so, provide enhanced, effective and transparent support for country-driven mitigation and adaptation actions in countries which need such support.  Mr. Co-Chairs, we have less than one year for the 2015 Agreement to become what we want it to be: a fair and ambitious legally-binding rules-based climate change agreement applicable to all Parties, taking into account CBDR/RC and equity and mutually supportive with human rights, gender equality and health policies.  The time we have left up to Paris is short and we have to work hard and focus on common ground, not on differences. We therefore fully support your suggested organization of work and especially to move to the next session after the allocated time and allow for the remaining interventions later in the week and support time limited break out groups to deepen or solve specific open issues.  We have the aim to leave Geneva with a streamlined negotiating text as well as a text for a possible COP draft decision accompanying the agreement. Therefore we would support you, the Co-chairs, to produce, if necessary, a clean draft on the basis of the discussions during this week and in the sense of 3 the ADP decision in Lima by May this year. Here in Geneva, we are ready to only make proposals if we want to bring in an idea that is not yet captured in the text but most importantly, proposals to streamline or replace existing text.  Last but not least, we would like to express our full support to you, the new Co-chairs of the ADP. We are looking forward to work with you throughout this important year and towards a successful outcome in Paris in December. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"'],\n",

First of all, we wish to congratulate you on your election as our Co-Chairs. I also wish to thank the Government of Switzerland for hosting this important meeting. The Group wishes to express its full support toward helping the Co-Chairs . guide us to a successful outcome to these negotiations. The Group of 77 and China represents about 85% of the world\\'s population. Our peoples suffer the effects of climate change first hand. Climate change threatens not only the development prospects of developing countries and their achievement of sustainable development but also the very existence and 1 survival of countries, societies and the ecosystems of our Mother Earth. You can therefore be assured of the group\\'s commitment to this process as we recognise the importance of a successful outcome in Paris. It is our expectation that the process leading up to Paris should be open, transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensus-building in order to arrive at a comprehensive, balanced and equitable outcome. More than two-thirds of the UNFCCC Parties are members of our Group. The Group .also encompasses at least 10 subgroups and our strength emanates from this diversity. There can be no meaningful and legitimate agreement if the concerns of the Group of 77 and China are not taken into account. We would like to recall that the objective of the APP is to enhance action and to promote the fl.Ill and effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention. Any attempts to redefine, rewrite, renegotiate or reinterpret the Convention and its principles and provisions that would result in a watering down or weakening of the Convention will not be acceptable and will only complicate and delay the process. The tasks of the ADP session here in Geneva are very clear in light of the decisions we have all committed ourselves to since Durban. Before turning to the key issues to be addressed in the agreement, we note that the current Elements , paper annexed to the Lima decision was not, due to time limitations, fully negotiated in Lima. This Elements paper is an expression of multiple views which must be considered in light of the decisions adopted in Lima. We agreed on timelines for our work, namely that we need to . complete the work of the ADP as early as possible in order to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties at the Paris COP. We also agreed that the ADP must make available a negotiating text before May 2015. We therefore support your determination to deliver a draft negotiating text by Friday. In order to deliver on this task, trust and mutual reassurances from all Parties, as well as the necessary political will and determination to find solutions for key issues, are essential. Any streamlining of the options should be based on consensus among Parties collectively and constructively, with Parties\\' views to be reflected in a balanced and comprehensive manner in the negotiating text. Co-Chairs, Under Workstream I, the Group reiterates that the 2015 agreement must be under the Convention, applicable to all Parties and based on its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Any agreement without equity and CBDR&RC is not in accordance with the Convention. We also decided that the 2015 agreement must be comprehensive in dealing with all the agreed elements, inter alia mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building and transparency of action and support required from developed to 4 developing countries, in a balanced manner. The Group also ?reiterates the crucial importance of appropriately, effectively and meaningfully addressing adaptation, finance and the need to secure progress in addressing the issue of loss and damage in the 2015 agreement. Other issues such as the adverse impacts of response measures and anchoring specific implementation mechanisms and frameworks in the 2015 Agreement should be addressed. The 2015 outcome should provide for enhanced financial and technological support from developed to developing countries for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions after 2020, especially to those developing countries that . are particular vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. These are fundamental prerequisites\\' for enabling developing countries\\' actions to address climate change and its impacts. Co-Chairs, The Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP that has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. The work of Workstream If should continue until the pre-2020 5 ambition gap is closed. Enhanced pre-2020 ambition will not ?? only provide a strong basis for post-2020 cooperation, but is also necessary to avoid higher costs and risks associated with adaptation and mitigation in the long run. Through Workstream II, we must work with the objective that countries increase mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period, and developed countries must take the lead; through enhanced actions, increasing emission reduction targets to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and the level of ambition on providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to assist developing country Parties in achieving the pledges that they have made. Workstream II is essentially about accelerating the implementation of existing commitments and ways to promote enhanced ambition.

At the outset allow me join others in congratulating you both on the appointment as the ADP Co-Chairs. LDCs stand ready to offer you our full cooperation this year, which is one? of the most crucial in the history of the international climate change negotiation process. I would like to associate my group with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of African Group of Negotiation (AGN), and by the Maldives on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). Co-Chairs, we are at a critical juncture of our work towards reaching an agreement on a legal text for adoption in Paris. We only have six days to progress from the elements for a draft negotiation text we elaborated in Lima as Annex to Decision 1/CP.20 to a legal and formal negotiating text to be communicated to all Parties in all the United Nations official languages by the end of May. We all understand how important it is to respect this legal requirement and we should endeavor to do so, even if the Lima COP set significant challenges for us. We L\\'DCs are ready to rise to this challenge. I would like to highlight a few key issues that should guide us in our deliberations for the next 6 days. First we believe that we should be working towards a protocol with legal , force to be made available to our leaders for signature at the Paris COP. Second, the new legal agreement should be firmly linked to the most recent science. We must be ambitious and brave in our efforts to ensure an increase in mean global temperatures of no more than 1.5 degree Celsius and fulfill the objective of the UNFCCC. Our collective efforts must recognize that the livelihood of people in the most vulnerable countries depends on an ambitious outcome, one at the scale of the challenge that we are currently facing. Worse is even to be expected, if we do not act with the greatest urgent. We cannot rely on simple pledges. We need strong commitments. Third, we believe that the legal text we develop should give balance to all the major elements arising from the Durban mandate and beyond, and ensure that actions in each of these take into account gender dimensions. A balanced text as the main outcome within a package covering all elements is critical for LDCs. We firmly believe that means of \\'implementation and adaptation are core elements of the Protocol. Forth, to ensure that all Parties take significant steps to reduce their emissions, we must ensure that ??there is new, additional and substantial finance to underwrite this effort. The new protocol should establish durable measures to ensure permanent arrangements for scaling up finance. Fifth, as our countries are already suffering from the severe and irreversible impacts of climate change, an effective response to adaptation is essential. The new legal agreement should properly recognize the importance of providing support for adaptation and to establish new and more effective institutional arrangements to support this effort. Sixth, as we stated in Lima, loss and damage must be a core element of the legal agreement. Loss and damage must be properly recognized as a standalone element separate from adaptation. This is simply due to the fact that loss and damage is a different concept from adaptation. As such co-chairs let us reiterate ou\"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We congratulate you, Co-Chairs, on your assumption of your tasks. We look forward to working with you in crafting a Party driven outcome in Paris that allows the global community to cooperate and effectively address climate change in a manner that is fully under the Convention and enhances its full, effective and sustained implementation. The global interest must be kept supreme as we also urgently need to protect the integrity of Mother Earth. Just a few weeks after Lima, we wish to highlight that the Lima Call for Climate Action represents and reflects the existence of consensus among the Parties on many aspects of our work under the ADP. In this regard, the elements text needs to be made consistent with the agreements reached in Lima, as in COP20 there was no opportunity to update the Annex after the adoption of the Lima decision. The outcome under the ADP must reflect these agreements, without backsliding or reopening the consensus achieved in that decision, such as: Our work is under the Convention and guided by its principles, provisions, and structure, including the differentiated commitments in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention; The Paris outcome shall reflect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as it is under the Convention. Concepts or approaches such as \\x1cevolving CBDR\\x1d or \\x1cParties in a position to do so\\x1d are not consistent with the Convention and are not acceptable. There has been consensus among Parties in Lima that such concepts shall be removed from the outcomes of the COP; It must address in a balanced manner all elements of paragraph 5 of the Durban decision 1/CP.17 mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building, and transparency of action and support; It shall strengthen adaptation action to address the particular vulnerabilities of developing countries, duly taking into account the relationship between poverty eradication and adaptation actions; Reaffirm the COP\\'s decisions on the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage and make these operational; Developed country Parties shall provide financial, technology transfer and capacity building support consistent with their obligations under the Convention to developing country Parties for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions before and after 2020, especially to Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change; There will be no ex ante review. Parties should address address pre-2020 ambition as matter of priority 2020 ambition as matter of priority through accelerating the implementation of paragraph 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. We stress that increasing the level of ambition on pre-2020 mitigation and pre-2020 finance, 2020 finance, technology transfer and capacity building support by developed country Parties must be fully technology transfer and capacity building support by developed country Parties must be fully implemented and operationalized as essential components of the Paris 2015 outcome. implemented and operationalized as essential components of the Paris 2015 outcome. We want to express our concern that since the adoption of Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocolo, only two developed country Parties have ratified the amendment. Evidently, there is a lack of ambition on on the part on the part of developed country Parties. of developed country Parties. This will have direct effects on the necessary relationship between pre and post 2020 commitments. Therefore we call upon the Annex I Parties to the Kyoto between pre and post 2020 commitments. Therefore we call upon the Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to advance the legal process of ratification to ensure the continuation of the multilateral legally binding effect of their mitigation commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.

The pursuit of sustainable development and economic diversification are therefore important to developing countries in fighting climate change. Full consideration must be given to what actions are necessary to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures.

              "       ['126,2,8,8,20150208,umbrella,\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. First let us welcome you to the chairmanship. We look forward to you guiding our efforts over the coming week to reach a draft negotiating text. As you have encouraged us to move straight into our work of delivering, by Paris, a new, ambitious, effective and globally applicable climate agreement, we will share briefly our priorities for this session. We are ready, as tasked, to work to deliver a first draft text of the new agreement. It is critical that that this text accurately reflects Parties\\' proposals. Without this, Parties may find it difficult to accept the text as the basis on which to take our work forward. At the same time, we should take opportunities to streamline the text - removing duplication, deleting provisions that have no support, and where possible improving the structure. We should also distinguish content appropriate for a legal agreement - that is durable and universal - from content more appropriate to decisions - that is more detailed, or needs updating overtime. We should steer away from a \\'one size fits all\\' treatment of mitigation, adaptation, support and transparency. Our challenge is to develop provisions for each area in a way that leads to the most effective practical outcomes on the ground. We should give more thought to how the new agreement will interrelate with the Convention and its institutions - ensuring we do not duplicate work that will continue under the Convention post2020, nor pre-empt how this work will evolve. To support our efforts to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention in Article 2, we must progress work on the rules by which countries will account for mitigation efforts, to maintain the transparency and integrity of the agreement. We are cognisant of the decision Parties reached in Lima where we underscored our commitment to reflect the principle of CBDRRC in light of different national circumstances in the Paris \\' Agreement. Neither an extreme of retaining the current fixed binary approach, nor an extreme of no differentiation will be acceptable. We need to look at specific approaches that treat very different national circumstances appropriately, and encourage Parties to regularly increase their ambition and improve their transparency. We also look forward to continuing our work on practical ways to build mitigation ambition. It is this action that will provide ballast to a Paris outcome on the new agreement, and to its implementation. We look forward to working with you and all Parties to make this a productive session. Thank you. \"'],\n",
              "       ['127,2,8,8,20150213,eu,\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This is a statement made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We came to Geneva with a clear objective of working towards adopting a legally binding agreement at COP21 that is capable of keeping us collectively on track to achieve the below 2?C objective. In that context we have done the minimum necessary to achieve the task set out by the Lima Call for Climate action. We have prepared a Party owned text to be circulated before May as the basis for our negotiations on the road to Paris. However, the pace of progress needs to radically change if we are to deliver a legally binding agreement in Paris. June will need to produce a text with clear options for Ministers. To achieve that, Parties will need to trust each other and the Co-Chairs. Here in Geneva it proved impossible to even consolidate near identical paragraphs, and as such we now have a text that is over double the length of the Lima text. The mode of work in June cannot be a simple continuation of our approach here in Geneva. In order to enter into real negotiations we need three things: Leadership from the Co-Chairs. We need guidance and homework for Parties ahead of the June session. This should take the form of a reflections note that proactively sets out ideas for how we can ensure that time in June is used effectively to ensure success in Paris. Clarity of process. Organisation of work for June should allow for parallel working under the contact group, addressing key issues in a balanced manner. We would also expect in June to have facilitated, issue specific, time limited groups to take things forward. Engagement in substance. Negotiations in June should be through Party engagement on the basis of text. To get to that point we need a shorter text that preserves the position of Parties. The Secretariat should produce a simple technical analysis of the text to indicate duplications, redundancies and identify paragraphs with similar ideas that could be streamlined. By time we next meet,\"'],\n",
              "       ['128,2,9,9,20150601,ag,\"Co-chairs, The Republic of Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. The African Group fully associates itself with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group 77 and China. As such the African Group would like to emphasise the important commitment to the unity of the G77 and China, and reaffirm the call for a multilateral rules-based system that enhances the implementation of the Convention, recognises the enormous contribution by developing countries going to 2020, and as such, calling on developed countries to scale up their support action in developing countries. Co-chairs, The African Ministers, having met in Cairo on the 05-06 March 2015, outlined a vision for a Paris Agreement that amongst others, Will be under the Convention, and in accordance with its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. Further, enhances the implementation of the Convention and its Annexes, consistent with science and equity, and further enhances a multilateral rules-based system in a balanced and ambitious manner;. Provides parity between mitigation and adaptation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries from the inadequate aggregate of mitigation efforts. Further, the agreement should ensure mitigation ambition keeps the world on track for a global temperature increase that is well below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century; Operationalises the global responsibility for adaptation, through a global goal for adaptation that enhances the implementation of adaptation commitments under the Convention, and recognises adaptation investments by developing countries, adaptation needs and costs including adequacy of support from developed countries; 4. Reaffirms the international obligation for all developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex II to provide climate finance to developing countries as a means to enhancing action towards achieving the objectives of the Convention. In line with the direction from our ministers, we would like to emphasise that the delivery on transparency, clarity on pathways and sources of finance to achieve the USD100 billion by 2020 cannot be seen as part of the Paris package in the context of weakening Annex II Party obligations to provide finance to developing country actions, rather as a trust building undertaking, that we do honour agreements under the Convention. Co-chairs, As a group we reaffirm our commitment to engage constructively, and support you in facilitating our negotiation in an effective and efficient manner, particularly with the limited time available for negotiation before Paris. It is in that spirit that we welcome your scenario note for this session, the envisaged outcome, as well as the mode of work for this session. Having reflected on your suggestions on how to conduct our work, we would like to present our views on your proposals, and how we can effectively and efficiently deliver on the outcomes of this session. We share the envisaged outcomes of this session, and believe that our proposals will assist you in delivering against those objectives. Firstly, we support the mode of work you have proposed where we will have a quick first reading of the Geneva Text, and we believe the document ADP.2015.2 Informal Note by the Secretariat could be useful in that regard. In light of time available, the overlaps and duplications \\x18within\\x19 paragraphs could serve as a good starting point. Secondly, we are of the view that the Secretariat Informal Note further presents overlaps and duplications in other paragraphs and sections. In this regard, our ability to effectively streamline the text depends on having space to understand at least the structure and form of the agreement. We, therefore, encourage you to create that space for the development of that understanding building on the ideas you have presented in Annex II of the scenario note. Thirdly, we note the use of the modality of having a working document whilst keeping the Geneva Text intact, which of course we support for various reasons. Understanding the Geneva Text as being the basis for negotiation, we would therefore foresee a situation where the Geneva text is revised based on streamlining progress being made as captured in the working document. We are weary of the working document becoming the basis of negotiation over time with the pretext that it reflects areas of agreement, whereas concerns of Parties in the Geneva Text become obsolete. Fourthly, with regards to the work of facilitators, we welcome their involvement to help you co-chairs to help us. We are rather concerned by the proposed slots at which the facilitations will take place as these coincide with our coordination times. Coordination help us digest views heard during the negotiation, and adjust our ideas to accommodate other views. We are prepared to work hard and make progress in the negotiation, and we are prepared to work late, as we see the facilitation being critical. Lastly, with regards to Workstream II, the Group believes that space is needed to comprehensively work towards a pre-2020 decision, which we see as a necessary step to build the trust and assurance on the implementation of existing agreements going to 2020. Workstream II of the Durban Platform is of utmost importance to the African Group. Co-chairs, All Parties, attending the African COP in Durban, South Africa, agreed that enhancing mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period is an urgent priority. Increasing ambition requires the following 3 key elements: Urgent leadership from developed countries expressed in increased mitigation and accelerated mobilization of the USD100 billion pledged to support the concrete adaptation and mitigation actions; Full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through the implementation of the outcomes of the Bali Action Plan; Beyond this - increasing ambition will require a substantially scaled-up \\x1cambition agenda\\x1d in the pre-2020 period. As a group, we would see such a decision covering both the facilitation of concrete opportunities and the implementation of existing decisions related to adaptation and means of implementation. Africa is working with all countries within the G77 and China to be able to present a submission that includes a clear structure, focused areas, and specific objectives and activities under one by next Thursday, at the contact group meeting. Co-chairs, We find it appropriate to further expand on the effort to support concrete implementation of renewable energy in Africa, and how it links the negotiation world to the real economy world. Today, the 54 countries of Africa have around 1 billion inhabitants and the continent\\x19s population will grow to around 2 billion by 2050. Ensuring the wellbeing of these people requires, among other things, access to reliable and affordable clean energy. Yet, today as many as 600 million people lack adequate access to such energy. To achieve its full potential, Africa must rapidly scale up access to energy, to meet the needs of an expanding population, while also curbing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to address the threat of climate change which, if left unchecked, will undermine development. Africa has taken international leadership by calling for an ambitious global partnership and support programme for the acceleration of renewable energy access and deployment in all countries. This proposal was endorsed by the African Environment Ministers, in March 2015, and called on the Green Climate Fund, and all partners to support the full operationalization of this Initiative for rapid and massive scaling-up. This effort is envisaged to go beyond traditional initiatives to deploy renewable energy, by seeking to develop a strategic framework that can enable transformation therefore addressing incentives at the demand side, supply side and international level in a holistic way. It recognizes that incremental progress will not be sufficient to achieve energy or climate goals, let alone to achieve both simultaneously. Africa, thus, requires an approach that is truly transformational. Co-chairs, The intention is to support African countries by providing a strategic framework for transformation that links goals for energy access, economic development, social wellbeing and climate change. Investment plans, catering both the Green Climate Fund and other sources, will be developed that reflect both the scale of the challenge and the specificities of each country. To this end, it supports the goals of the UN Climate Convention, and in the short-term, contributes to the expected outcomes of a new 2015 climate agreement. To close the access gap by 2030 and enhance the energy infrastructure of African countries to modern, smart systems conducive to an important share of renewable energy in the longer term will require significant investments. By enabling such investments as early as possible, vast savings will be achieved over time. The missing piece ? leveraging the ??on-switch?? required to spark the uptake of renewables and spur new and ??bankable?? projects ? is enhanced public finance to catalyze new projects, guarantee safe investment conditions for both the private and public sectors over several decades, provide concessional credits for upfront investment, and support fixed costs associated with capacity-building, training and smart grid upgrades. Co-chairs, To address these elements, the Initiative will take place in two phases. Phase 1: Between now and 2020 the Initiative will enable the installation of at least 10,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in the continent. At least $5 billion in public and highly concessional finance between 2016 and 2020, from bilateral, multilateral and other sources, including the Green Climate Fund, will be needed to leverage a further USD15 billion in other investments, for a total investment of at least USD20 billion pre-2020. Phase 2: In the second phase, the initiative will catalyze a major transformation by 203\"'],\n",

Co-President, I am pleased to start this intervention with news of great importance to AILAC: we have received as a new member of our group the Republic of Paraguay, another ambitious and constructive country, which shares the spirit of AILAC, and which is now joining the efforts of our group to build bridges, reach consensus, and reach a legally binding agreement, and with legal commitments for all the States Parties, that allow us to effectively face the global challenge of climate change. For AILAC it is an honor to welcome you to Paraguay. Let me start by associating ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, AILAC appreciates your effort in organizing the work for this session, and acknowledges through you the work done by the UNFCCC Secretary in terms of overlaps and duplications in the Geneva text. We trust that both instruments, together with their extensive experience, will be fundamental inputs to guide our discussions in this crucial year for negotiations. AILAC values ??the consistent application of procedural rules and working methodologies that are established based on the scenario note, for an effective exchange between the parties during our sessions, 6. AILAC wishes to congratulate the 38 parties that have communicated their contributions to date, in particular the efforts of Mexico and Gabon, countries that have complied with the first indicative date, including Adaptation and Means of Implementation, which are especially relevance to this process; 7. AILAC member countries wish to confirm their determination to communicate their contributions before October, so that they are considered in the fundamental synthesis report of the secretariat, on the aggregate effect of the contributions. In the same way, we call on all UNFCCC member countries to communicate their contributions as soon as possible. Co-Chairs, we are concerned that the percentage of global emissions covered by INDCs reported to date, as well as the level of ambition of some INDCs, still does not guarantee a consistent trajectory with the objective of limiting the increase in temperature by below 2 or 1.5 ?? C, nor the planet\\'s resilience to the impacts of climate change; Co-Presidents, AILAC wishes to recognize the progress made in Geneva under its leadership, materialized in the \"\"eneva text\"\", which allows us to progress on the basis of the Lima Call for Climate Action, towards a legally binding, ratifiable agreement, applicable to all parts and lasting beyond 2030, to be adopted in Paris. We hope during this session to advance at the same pace and we come prepared to make the most of the 20 days of negotiation that we have left before COP21. Co-Presidents, AILAC has used the comparative tables prepared by the Secretary and our own analyzes of duplications and overlaps, with a view to merging paragraphs and options within the text, in line with the scenario note. In this order of ideas, AILAC recognizes the fundamental value of the progress that can be captured in a working document, marking progress towards the construction of a document produced on time and with the participation of all parties, for its adoption at COP21 in Paris; AILAC considers that our negotiations would benefit if we agree in this ADP session on a clear and transparent method to achieve synthetic and coherent texts as a result of the negotiations. We welcome the Co-Chair Scenario Note promoting transparency, inclusiveness, and openness to input from Parties, including the early appointment of facilitators to support work towards COP21. We invite all parties to work constructively with them towards reducing the text and seeking convergence. Finally, our group considers that it is essential to advance in legal matters related to the form of the future Paris agreement. We must learn from the past, and move forward as soon as possible in explicitly addressing the discussion on legal aspects of the Agreement and in particular on the legally binding nature of the instrument that we are going to adopt at COP21. For this we consider that the creation of a discussion group under the ADP, which addresses these issues, is very useful. Thank you very much.  \"'],\n",
              "       ['130,2,9,9,20150601,alba,\"This intervention is on behalf of the following members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA): Cuba, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. First, add this intervention to those made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and Iran by the Group of Like-Thinking Developing Countries (LMDC). Since the Copenhagen Conference in 2009, our countries have redoubled their sovereign efforts and actions in the fight against climate change and have committed to the highest level of Government to reach a fair, equitable and science-based agreement that allows effectively implement the principles and norms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to save Mother Earth from the devastating consequences of climate change. ALBA firmly believes that a true solution to reverse the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and its repercussions on the climate must be based on the urgent need to change the system that has caused this global problem and thus be able to remedy the changes that have been generated in the climate. The unsustainable models of production and consumption, the excessive accumulation of capital, the depletion of natural resources are the fundamental causes that put the biophysical limits of the planet at risk. The future agreement cannot be based on the continuation of false promises or false solutions that rewrite the causes that have generated the problem. It is necessary to incorporate into this debate an ethical vision and commitment to Mother Earth to achieve the ambition that the world requires to overcome the systemic crises in which we find ourselves. An ethical approach to the climate change negotiation process is essential, even more so when we are just a few months away from the 21st Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the COP-21 in Paris. The principles should not be reinvented, there is already the fundamental concept of sustainable development. Avoid introducing completely biased and interested concepts that divert attention from the integral transformation towards an equitable, just and sustainable society in harmony with the cycles of nature. This transformation, which must also be fair and equitable instead of deepening current inequities, must necessarily go through the rationalization of unsustainable patterns of production and, particularly, of consumption in the so-called developed countries. Political will to reach an agreement The scientific evidence has already been provided and the countries, regardless of their levels of responsibilities, including the ALBA countries, are already suffering the terrible consequences of climate change. The least responsible countries have been the most affected and we are now the least likely to live if current global GHG emissions patterns are maintained. The main difficulty in making decisive progress in combating global climate change continues to be the lack of political will of developed countries to act in accordance with the historic responsibility recognized by the Convention. ALBA is committed to reaching an agreement that will enter into force in the year 2020 to limit greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize below 1.5 ? C, considering that COP-21 in Paris is the space in which the Parties must achieve this objective. The provisions of the future agreement The entire multilateral negotiation process must be open, inclusive and transparent, with full respect for the principle of equality between States. The agreement to be reached in Paris must be an agreement to reinforce the current climate change regime: the Framework Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, not to replace it. This is a process framed in the Convention and therefore must contemplate its principles and provisions. Sustainable development is the universal reference for these discussions, which cannot be confused with other new terms that detract from the evolution of this concept. Another substantial element of the new agreement is differentiation based on the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), recognized by the Convention. Not all countries have the same responsibilities because not all countries have contributed the same amount of GHG emissions, that not all countries have had the same level of compliance in limiting these emissions, and that atmospheric space does not it is being used equitably. The new agreement within the framework of the Climate Change Convention must contemplate a system with fair rules for developing and vulnerable countries to climate change, which includes national priorities such as the eradication of poverty and our right to sustainable development. Why adaptation is a key issue in the future agreement Adaptation to climate change is a central issue in the future international climate regime, taking into account the high vulnerability of developing countries. In this context, it is urgent that developed countries provide the necessary financial resources so that the Adaptation Fund of the Convention remains operational and for the implementation of the Green Climate Fund Nationally Determined Expected Contributions (INDC) It is irrational and unfair to try to impose that developing countries are the ones that must cover the default quotas of those countries with historical responsibilities in the origin and acceleration of the problem of global warming of the planet. The right to development must not be curtailed sustainable development of our peoples, who suffer most from the consequences of climate change and the right and responsibility of all countries to achieve the eradication of poverty, in all its multiple dimensions. Mitigation must be oriented in a legal sense and international responsibility. Not all countries are currently carrying out their obligations under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and this damages the right to development of other countries and even fundamental human rights to life, health, food, to develop in a healthy environment. There is a need for a binding mitigation agreement based on justice and equity, the principles of the Convention and historical responsibilities. Those responsible for climate change must commit to reducing their emissions and providing the means for other countries to reduce them on a voluntary basis, without affecting their possibilities and their right to development. It is unquestionable that developing countries are voluntarily making more contributions in the pre-2020 period than developed countries. The fulfillment by the developed parties of the historical commitments assumed in the framework of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol is essential and, therefore, INDCs must be associated with Article 4 of the Convention where the distinctions regarding obligations are identified of the countries. ALBA countries note with concern that the issue of INDCs is intended to become the central issue in the negotiation and this should not be the case. The negotiation must have a comprehensive and holistic vision in relation to climate change that will allow developing countries to have the endorsement and / or support that allows them to undertake a responsibility of these dimensions. INDCs are only one of the elements of the agreement. For developing countries they should be considered on a voluntary basis, with a comprehensive approach and according to the national circumstances of each country. Taking into account that they are contributions to achieve the objective of the Convention, they should cover all its elements, not only the scope of mitigation. They must understand the adaptation, needs and priorities of developing sectors at the national level, the eradication of poverty. INDCs by themselves will not allow the global goal of 1.5 to be reached, but are accompanied by means of implementation. There is a reference element that constitutes an antecedent for this process, the commitments (pledges) of the countries that assumed the \\x1cCopenhagen agreement\\x1d as binding, were made at COP-16 in Cancun, one year after \\x1cTake note \\x1dOf the Copenhagen agreement. Decision 1.CP / 15 was adopted and then the accession of the countries was promoted through their pledges. The means of implementation For the validity of a future agreement it is essential that the means of implementation be considered, this will allow all countries to be able to be part of an agreement that provides them with the means to make their reduction and / or reduction commitments plausible. emission avoidance and adaptation. Therefore, a feasible agreement must include in a balanced way the following elements: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation (financing, technology transfer and capacity building) that allow reaching the means to make mitigation and adaptation actions feasible. The financing issue is undoubtedly one of the most important, which must be channeled through the bodies created within the framework of the Convention. Increased participation of developing countries in global emissions reduction efforts must be commensurate with the existence of a real framework of new, additional and predictable financial resource flows that developed countries must provide. Adaptation is a fundamental priority for developing countries and, therefore, it is also an obligation for developed countries to finance adaptation actions. Financing must be for mitigation and adaptation. Technology and support that enables the renovation of more efficient and less environmentally damaging technology parks are also a priority for developing countries. It is important that technology transfer does not become a technology market or a way to deepen technological dependency. Technology transfer should be oriented according to Article 4.5 of the Convention, which says: \\x1cParties that are developed countries will support the development and improvement of endogenous capacities and technologies of Parties that are developing countries\\x1d. The development of endogenous technological capabilities in developing countries is crucial and includes the ability to adapt and improve existing technologies. For this, it is necessary to establish provisions so that intellectual property systems do not constitute a barrier to effectively and fairly undertake adaptation and mitigation. Ongoing training in the use of new state-of-the-art technologies that allow its modernization to face the problems of climate change is also an important priority for developing countries, as well as the spread of technologies that are feasible to implement according to the characteristics and requirements own countries. A pending discussion is the issue of patent liberalization for those technologies that serve to fight global warming. The fundamental interest is the massification of these technologies, according to the potential that each country has, as was the case for HIV-AIDS drugs and the Doha Declaration in 2001 on intellectual property and health. Alternative measures and responses to climate change must be considered for countries whose economies depend on mono-export of hydrocarbons, and which cannot compromise the right to well-being of their populations and their development. The legal nature of the Paris agreement The principles must be those provided by International Law and the legal basis of the Paris agreement is undoubtedly the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, its principles and provisions. The agreement must be universal, binding, contemplate differentiation and include all the elements in a balanced way, providing the means to ensure compliance. The comparability of efforts and results should only be applicable to groups of countries in the same circumstances and therefore the issue of differentiation is fundamental between developed and developing countries. The agreement must be legally binding for all countries and must include a mechanism for monitoring and verifying compliance with objectives (adaptation, compensation for loss and damage and reduction of emissions) and goals (contribution of financing and technology transfer). Exactly one year after this session, in June 2014, a proposal was presented for the creation of a Legal Contact Group Submission with the aim of fulfilling Durban\\'s mandate on \\x1ca protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome under the Convention applicable to all Parties \\x1dto support the work of ADP and provide advice on the negotiating process in this context. However, to date, no proposal has been made to allow the Parties to assess the implications of the different legal forms. It is important to consider this proposal to create a legal contact group open to all parties and made up of experts in their legal field, just six months after the call in Paris. Specifying the vision of what the Paris meeting represents 2015 is not the end but the starting point of a process that must continue to meet the goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 agreement must provide for a review clause and the possibility of setting new goals for the future, so that the process is not interrupted and a situation of legal vacuum occurs. It is necessary to learn from past lessons, with the approval of the subsequent periods of the Kyoto Protocol being a benchmark when completing the first commitment period in 2012. The future agreement must be sustainable over time and therefore implementation requires be associated with the means of financing. The legal framework of the text that will guarantee any commitment to the INDC is essential so that the countries can present and have the certainty of where this contribution will be inserted. Without certainty of this context, they should only be mandatory for Annex I countries. The Paris agreement could be an annex adopted by a decision of the Conference of the Parties, and after the COP-21 in Paris a Plan de Work and foresee the term for deposit instruments between the period 2016-2020, as well as the possibility of registering INDCs. This new instrument should enter into force in 2020. New challenges in negotiation and their implications Among the proposals that have been configured as alternatives in the negotiation there are very important aspects, which must be discussed in depth due to their implications.

Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for your diligent work and assure you of our support as we move into these critical discussions in the final months before Paris. Since we last met in Geneva, Cyclone Pam and Typhoon Maysak left a trail of destruction in our member states of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and FSM killing dozens, upending businesses and agriculture and destroying 90 percent of the housing stock in some of the affected communities. These extreme weather events are happening in the context of an average global temperature increase of less than 1 degree C, reminding us that without bold and very urgent action, far worse is yet to come and all countries will be affected. The findings from the recent technical report from the Structured Expert Dialogue of the 2013-2015 Review should give us all very serious cause for concern: 2 degrees of warming is associated with very high risks that are incompatible with the objectives of the Convention. That said, the report confirms that limiting warming to well below 1.5 degrees C is still feasible, but requires early peaking and sharp reductions in global emissions. The science of the IPCC WG3 and 2014 UNEP Gap Report further shows that zero global GHG emissions would be needed by 2060-2080. To that end, the view of the most vulnerable countries, and the majority of Parties to the Convention is the right one - a 1.5 degree limit must be a part of the Paris agreement for the sake of present and future generations. Co-Chairs, Under all projected scenarios, avoiding the worst impacts of climate change require us to rapidly scale up and implement solutions in the near term. We believe Workstream 2 under the ADP, which focuses on pre-2020 ambition, has already produced a useful set of good practices and policy options for ramping up ambition. We look forward to advancing this work during the follow up Technical Expert Meetings on renewable energy and energy efficiency at this session. Co-Chairs, In terms of the Paris agreement, we have our work cut out for us here if we hope to stay on track for the looming deadline. Progress has been made, with a number of Parties coming forward with their iNDCs and pledges for the Green Climate Fund. AOSIS members are committed to tabling our iNDCs as soon as possible. But the truth is that the emissions reductions required to guarantee the survival of the members of AOSIS don??t yet add up, and we still find ourselves a long way short of the goal of $100 billion a year by 2020 in climate finance agreed in in Cancun. AOSIS is of the view that the 2015 agreement must be an ambitious, legally binding Protocol capable of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees. It needs to be designed to increase ambition through consecutive commitments toward achieving our long-term goal, and it must fill gaps in current climate finance architecture and flows, including the significant increased of support for adaptation projects in most-vulnerable countries and promote enhanced mitigation efforts. The barriers to access for capacity-constrained countries must also be addressed.

We express our strong desire to make further progress during this session, by making balanced progress among the six mandated elements of the 2015 agreement under the Durban Platform, i.e., mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-?\\x10building and transparency of action and support, as well as giving proper and adequate consideration to workstream 2. The BASIC countries believe that achieving consensus requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules?\\x10based regime under the Convention, in full accordance with its principles, and provisions. The Paris agreement should enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, not create a new regime or restructure, reinterpret or rewrite the Convention. Co\\x10Chairs We have before us the complex task of streamlining and reducing the draft negotiating text, in a matter that is open, fully transparent, inclusive and Party-?\\x10driven, with a view to building consensus. With that in mind we support your proposed way forward. It is the view of the group that we must advance on all the six elements mandated in Durban, in a balanced manner and coherent structure. Coherence is also fundamental to address cross-?\\x10cutting issues in all sections of the negotiating text, in particular differentiation between developed and developing countries and the application of the principles of equity and CBDR &RC. In this regard, the group underscores the need for the provisions of the agreement to fully reflect different responsibilities and development stages of developed and developing countries. BASIC countries would like to underline our view that the so-?called \\x1cself differentiation\\x1d approach is not consistent with the principles and provisions of the Convention, nor with the Durban mandate or the Lima Call for Climate Action. While Parties may nationally determine their own contributions in the context of the current Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) process, they can not unilaterally determine or rewrite their commitments or obligations under the legal framework of the Convention. BASIC countries also do not support efforts by some Parties to take key issues, such as climate finance, outside the scope of the Convention in an effort to bypass its unique legal character. The 2015 agreement is a vehicle to enhance the implementation of commitments in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention. This requires honoring and implementing existing commitments and responsibilities by developed countries. Enhanced action will not be achieved by shifting these burdens to developing countries, who have already taken on the largest and disproportionate share of the burden on a voluntary basis and often without support -?\\x10 even though they are not the ones with primary responsibility for causing climate change. It is also important to take into account that adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change experienced and the challenges faced by developing countries both and in the future and hence adaptation is an issue which requires a global response, in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. BASIC countries are intensifying domestic preparations for our intended nationally determined contributions towards the objective of the Convention, as decided in the UN Warsaw and Lima Climate Conferences. We would like to indicate that the results of our current ambitious national initiatives will be duly reflected in our respective contributions, as appropriate. Co?\\x10Chairs, The group would like to express its views regarding the time allocated to and scope of workstream 2. Although, the TEMs have been helpful it is important to note that workstream 2 is not limited to TEMs only. It should also cover pre2020 ambition not only focusing on mitigation but adaptation and means of implementation for developing countries. As such, more time should be dedicated to discuss other aspects of workstream 2 issues and ways to ensure that enhanced actions are agreed to in a draft decision text on pre 2020 ambitions. Regarding the pre-???2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-???2020 mitigation ambition and call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period. We note with concern that the pre-??2020\"'],\n",
              "       ['133,2,9,9,20150601,caricom,\"Co-chairs, I am pleased to take the floor on behalf of CARICOM, an alliance of 14 Caribbean countries, already suffering severely from the impacts of climate change. I would like to bring to your attention the CARICOM Declaration for Climate Action, in May of this year, in advance of the Franco-Caribbean Summit on Climate Change, held in Martinique on 9 May, 2015. In this declaration, the Heads of States and Governments of CARICOM countries recognised that extreme weather and slow onset events and their adverse impacts including sealevel rise, coastal erosion, coral bleaching, flooding, ocean acidification, and sea temperature rise, related to climate change, are fundamental threats to the sustainable development of Caribbean countries and island territories. Our leaders further noted that, already, with global warming of less than a degree, Caribbean countries are experiencing more frequent and intense storms, droughts, extreme weather events, accelerating sea-level rise and other life-threatening impacts. They emphasised that the global goal of limiting average temperature increase to below 2?C levels is inadequate for protecting fragile ecosystems in SIDS as some ecosystems in the Caribbean are already approaching the limits of their adaptive capacities. Consequently, there is an urgent need to close the gap between the current mitigation commitments of Parties and the level of effort required to hold the increase in global average temperature to below 1.50C above pre-industrial levels. Our leaders also expressed concern over the inadequacy of the financial resources made available by the international community to support the actions required to reduce the impacts of climate change in the Caribbean and recognised the role of forests in mitigating climate change, and the importance of anchoring the Warsaw REDD Plus Framework in the 2015 Agreement. Co-chairs, The ADP negotiations, which culminate in Paris, France, in December 2015, will be critical to closing the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap and to securing a new universal agreement that focuses the efforts of all Parties towards stronger climate action. Caribbean countries have exhibited leadership, including through agreement on a common framework to support the transformation of their energy systems. We are adopting ambitious national strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, Caribbean countries, together with other SIDS, have continued to emphasize the need for ambitious and urgent action to address climate change, and further, that SIDS, as lowlying and small island countries, remain a special case, considering our unique and particular vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. This is recognised in the Convention and has been acknowledged by the international community in multiple international fora since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. Co-Chairs, This June Session is critical for moving us toward a successful outcome in Paris. We agree that we should develop from this session a streamlined version of the Geneva text which will place us in a position to make the best use of our time up until Paris. In order to do this, it is critical that, even while the process remains party-driven, you are empowered to present Parties with options which can form the basis for negotiations and substantive discussions. At this stage, there is a heightened need to move the process forward with urgency if we are to have a chance of concluding an ambitious agreement in December, 2015. Micro-management of the process by Parties should therefore be avoided. Co Chairs, We wish to draw to your attention the report of the Structured Expert Dialogue on the 2013-2015 Review of the long term global temperture goal. This report underscores the position long held by CARICOM, AOSIS, and other vulnerable countries, that the agreed goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius is inadequate and will result in severe and unacceptable consequences for threatened ecosystems and socio-economic stability in vulnerable countries, in particular for small island developing and low-lying coastal States. It is clear that this Report, the result of a two-year rigourous examination of the relevant findings of the 5th Assessment Report of the IPCC, as well as other reliable inputs, must be considered as a critical contribution to the ongoing discussions in the ADP, in particular as it relates to a decision on the long term global mitigation goal. The report is a firm basis for Parties to take a decision to enhance the existing 2 degrees goal to 1.5 degrees consistent with meeting the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. The summary of the findings of the Structured Expert Dialogue on the 2013-2015 Review are also relevant for our treatment of the issue of loss and damage. The SED has found that significant climate impacts are already occurring at the current level of warming, and that substantial adverse and irreversible impacts of climate change will remain under all levels of warming, even with adaptation. This underscores the point that, even in low emissions scenarios, SIDS will experience substantial loss and damag\"'],\n",

Mr. Co-chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chair our Coalition is well prepared and determined to move the process forward and immediately begin work. In particular, we reiterate that the solution to the climate change problem cannot ignore the vital role that rainforests play in both the mitigation and the adaptation to climate change. Current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not stabilize temperatures under the 1.5C scenario unless the contribution of rainforests is fully taken into account. Therefore, the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ must be anchored broadly in all relevant sections of the 2015 agreement. REDD+ can offer a practicable and costeffective solution to close the mitigation ambition gap. Reductions of GHG emissions through REDD+ must be implemented on the basis of the most recently agreed IPCC estimation methodologies.

Before I make our statement, I would like to express the Group\\x19s condolences to the people of Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh for the devastation and tragic loss of life they suffered recently subsequent to the earthquake of 25 April. This and other disasters, many of which are climate related, are sobering reminders to us all of the vulnerability of mankind to natural disasters. Co-Chairs My Group wishes to express its full support to the Co-Chairs as they guide us to a successful outcome to these negotiations. We also thank the Co-Chairs for their scenario note and recognise the secretariat\\x19s work in identifying overlaps and duplications in the Geneva text. We also hope that we can find the time and space during this session in Bonn to address important cross-cutting issues, such as structure, legal form and differentiation, which we believe will catalyse progress in the negotiations. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of openness, inclusiveness and transparency in this process. Co-Chairs Climate change is already having serious impacts in developing countries. Despite the fact that we have not chosen this reality, developing countries are committed to address the challenge of climate change. In fact, we have proved that we already do more than what was already envisaged by the Convention. For many years we have been taking ambitious action on all fronts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, without adequate and predictable means of implementation. Indicative of developing countries\\x19 commitment is the hard work currently underway to prepare INDCs in order to submit these well in advance of Paris. Developing countries are embarking on the INDC process, despite the fact that developed countries are not putting forward intended commitments with respect to the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building. In this regard, the commitment of developing countries to address climate change is of great significance, particularly since developed countries have not honoured their existing obligations under the Convention: neither as far as the actions required from them, nor as far as the provision of the necessary means of implementation to developing countries. Also indicative of developing countries\\x19 commitment to this process is the fact that the Doha Amendment has so far been accepted by 29 developing countries and only 3 developed countries. Recognition by developed countries of the contributions already made by developing countries is critically important and can help to unlock difficult issues in the negotiations. It is in this context that the G77 and China are here in Bonn to call on developed countries to demonstrate their commitment to addressing climate change by agreeing to the following: Honouring existing commitments under the Convention and Kyoto Protocol  Developed countries need to honour their existing commitments. This means respecting the principles and provisions of the Convention, including the principle of CBDR&RC and equity, which have been reaffirmed in Lima, as well as advancing important implementation issues under the subsidiary bodies. ADP: pre-2020 ambition With regard to the work of the ADP in particular, the Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre-2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP that has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. Workstream II is essentially about accelerating the implementation of existing commitments and ways to promote enhanced ambition and will be critical for an agreement in Paris. This includes honouring their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, including the acceptance of the Doha Amendment, as well as substantially increasing their ambition for the second commitment period and their Copenhagen/Cancun pledges. It also includes developed countries?? commitment to mobilise US$100 billion in climate finance by 2020, a clear pathway to achieve this and pledges made to the Green Climate Fund. Post-2020 Regime With regard to the Paris agreement, the G77 and China call for a comprehensive and equitable outcome dealing with all the agreed element, inter alia mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support in a balanced manner. To achieve this, we need the commitment of our partners to work towards a multilaterally agreed outcome in Paris that is inclusive and rules-based, applicable to all Parties under the Con\"'],\n",

Mr Co-Chairs, Let us also renew our deep solidarity to our colleagues and to all the people of Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh for the dramatic events that hit all these countries in the past recent weeks and months. The events in Nepal should remind us not only how vulnerable, any country could be in the face of extreme events, but how much greater is the vulnerability of those that are the least developed among us. Mr Co-Chairs, may you also accept our appreciation for your diligent efforts in leading the work of the ADP since the beginning of this year. Even, if the achievement so far is highly estimable, the tasks at hand remain paramount. We commend your efforts to reach before the beginning of this session an agreed modus operandi on the way Parties are going to conduct the process. The LDC group would like to continue to give you its support and agree with your proposal to start substantive negotiations immediately after a short opening plenary. However, we would like to highlight few points of the utmost importance. 2 The LDC believe there is a need for careful balance between the progress needed to achieve an Agreement in Paris and the treatment of the process that will be driving this ahead. Here, your role as the Co-Chairs and the role of the current and incoming COP presidents are really fundamental. We would like to thank the secretariat for the tool provided on areas of overlaps and duplication. We will continue to use it, to guide us navigating throughout the negotiation text, identifying where our common views are and outlining more clearly where the real divergences are. Certainly, they will appear to us at least less numerous than they seem to be throughout the current text. Mr Co-Chairs, as we all know, the final report of the 2013-?\\x102015 Review has arrived at the conclusion that \\x1cthe \\x18guardrail\\x19 concept, in which up to 2?C of warming is considered safe, is not adequate\\x1d. The report clearly states that less warming would be preferable. What this means is clear: Warming needs to be kept to below 1.5?C degrees. The Structured Expert Dialogue thus directly lends stringent, scientific support to our position on a 1.5?C as a scientifically defensible global goal. It is critical that these strong conclusions and insights be translated into decisions and fostered actions: all Parties to urgently raise ambition, to commit toward an ambitious outcome in Paris under the ADP, outcome that address adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology, capacity building, loss and damage and transparency at the scale required by the challenge at hand. On work stream 2, our expectations in Paris are not limited to a renewed work program on enhancing mitigation ambition in the pre 2020 period and the continuation of the technical examination meetings and processes. We are looking forward the adoption and the launching of initiatives that will effectively result in enhancing mitigation by 2020 with the view to close the mitigation gap. During this session, opportunity should be given to Parties to indicate what further actions and initiatives they will be willing to launched and supported from 2015, with the view to enhance mitigation ambition and close the gap by\"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, we are now close to what we hope is the end of the journey in the ADP that we started in Durban almost four years ago. We look forward to an agreed outcome in Paris that addresses all the six core elements from the Durban mandate in a balanced manner, reflects the equitable principles of the Convention particularly the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and will result in enhanced action in the context of sustainable development in implementing the UNFCCC both before and after 2020. We have continually stressed that this outcome must be achieved through an open, transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensus-building process, marked by direct negotiations among the Parties on the basis of texts that they have produced themselves. These are the benchmarks by which we will assess both the success and the legitimacy of the outcome in Paris. Co-Chairs, as developing countries, despite the multiple challenges that we continue to face in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication, the countries of the LMDC have undertaken ambitious domestic actions on climate change including on mitigation and adaptation, and in surmounting the losses and damages arising from climate change-related natural disasters, while pursuing various sustainable development pathways and eradicating poverty. We can do more of these climate actions now, up to and beyond 2020 with increased levels of international cooperation from our developed country partners through increasing ambition and action on their part to drastically reduce their emissions and to provide additional, adequate and predictable levels of finance, development and transfer of technology and know-how, and capacity-building support to developing countries. We call on developed countries to do more to honor and fulfill their obligations under the Convention \\x13 to be more ambitious on mitigation than is shown in what they have put forward in their Cancun pledges and Kyoto Protocol commitments up to 2020 and in their INDCs for post 2020, and to provide and substantially enhance financial, technology and know-how development and transfer, and capacity building support for developing countries to adequate and predictable levels in support of developing countries\\' climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. Co-Chairs, we have proactively and constructively put forward textual proposals that reflect the best way through which the Convention\\x19s implementation will be fully, effectively and sustainably enhanced before and after 2020, in which the Convention\\x19s principles, provisions, and structure are fully respected and reflected in a way that is in full accordance with the differentiated obligations and commitments of developed and developing countries, and is consistent with Article 4 of the Convention. Increasing ambition includes holistically reflecting the inegrated treatment of mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to 2 developing country Parties. The Paris outcome must also incorporate a meaningful approach to address the adverse impacts of response measures. We reiterate that what we will achieve in Paris must be under the Convention, guided by the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention. The result must be to enhance the implementation of the Convention in order to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2, and not to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or replace the Convention or reinterpret its principles and provisions. The concepts or approaches such as \\x1cevolving CBDR\\x1d or \\x1cParties in a position to do so\\x1d are not consistent with the principles of the Convention and are not acceptable. Concepts such as these and issues that did not obtain consensus among the Parties through the COP in Lima such as an ex ante review (whether or not in the guise of an INDC workshop) may not be made part of the work of the ADP in the run-up to Paris as they only make it more difficult to achieve trust and build confidence in this process. We stress that Parties\\' INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 must be consistent with the Parties\\x19 respective obligations and commitments under Article 4 of the Convention. In this context, we expect developed country Parties to communicate well in advance of Paris their INDCs not only on post-2020 emission reduction targets but also on post-2020 targets, policies and measures for the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to developing countries. We stress that the INDCs by developing country Parties on post-2020 enhanced action, including as appropriate, mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage are to be prepared, communicated and implemented in the context of achieving sustainable development and the implementation of Article 4.7 of the Convention. Pre-2020 ambition should be primarily achieved through the implementation of the outcomes of the Bali Roadmap. Therefore, accelerating the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw COP decision 1/CP.19 and paragraph 17 and 18 of the Lima Call for Climate Action (decision 1/CP.20) must be the priority of the pre-2020 outcomes in Paris.

Like others, Umbrella Group countries wish to get straight to work to deliver an ambitious, effective and globally applicable legal climate change agreement by Paris. We thank you for your detailed scenario note. We continue to see our main objective under workstream 1 as delivering a concise, durable and operational legal agreement. As a step toward this, we welcome the opportunity to work on streamlining the negotiating text and starting to consolidate options to build areas of convergence. As part of this exercise we should: Identify content that is more appropriate for decision text, as distinct from provisions that are suitable for a durable legal agreement including by considering what work can appropriately be done after Paris and where this should be done; Focus on areas of the text where there is opportunity to build better conceptual understanding, as a basis for building convergence. These could include the nature of adaptation commitments; process for finalisation and update of mitigation contributions; aggregate review; transparency and the global goal; Continue to keep in mind matters relating to the structure of the agreement. Umbrella Group countries are committed to submitting our iNDCs well in advance of Paris, as we agreed in Warsaw and Lima - many have already been submitted, and others are working hard to submit in coming weeks. We look forward to participating in the event on INDCs here in Bonn. We also look forward to Technical Experts Meetings on renewable energy supply and energy efficiency in urban environments. And we look forward to work on a workstream 2 decision for Paris, focussed on building on the important decision we took in Lima, and enhancing TEMs beyond 2015.

Co-Chairs, The African Group believes that we are on the right track, even though we need to pick up speed of the negotiations. Noting that we have only 10 days of negotiating time before Paris, the notion of inter-sessional work by co-chairs to assist Parties in making the text more negotiable and concise, with clear options for Parties to negotiate is particularly useful. This inter-sessional work requires a careful balance that would allow Parties to engage in negotiations on the first day of the August session. Our vision for the process going forward, which we trust is shared by a number of Parties, is that of a step-wise progression such that no Parties are left behind. It is a vision where in August we spend most of our efforts on negotiating the text in its entirety to clearer options that are manageable; Whilst the October session would be a space where we further negotiate the various options in the context of what would be in the core agreement, and what would be in supplementary decisions to the agreement, and accompanying decisions, particularly with regards to Workstream II. Co-Chairs, On the issue of what would be in the core agreement, and what would be in supplementary decisions, in light of time available and the need to have a durable agreement, it is our view that the 2015 Agreement should reflect Articles that enhance the implementation of Article 4 provisions of the Convention. The Articles of the new agreement should have balance in legal form for all elements, particularly support to developing countries. Those aspects that pertain to international processes to implement its provisions should also be defined in the agreement, with an understanding that more work would need to be undertaken between 2016 and 2020 to bring them to effect. Co-Chairs, On Workstream II, the African Group, like other developing country sub-groups, worked diligently with the G77 and China to advance a comprehensive and ambitious elements text on pre-2020 action, containing: a section on the work programme on pre-2020 action; a section of the Accelerated implementation in the pre-2020 period; a section on both The Mitigation Technical Expert Process and a section on An adaptation Technical Expert Process; a section on Multilateral cooperation, and a section on Enhancing high-level engagement. Co-Chairs, We appreciate the work done by our co-facilitators in producing a note capturing the current status of the discussion. In the next iteration of such a note we would plea for an integration of both the submissions made by G77 and China on behalf of all developing countries as well as reflecting the very rich conversations we have had through our 4 facilitations. The African Group wishes to reiterate its support to the co-chairs, and recognise the role that co-chairs have in helping the process to arrive at a successful outcome in Paris. We would further affirm the need for the co-chairs to provide clear guidance to the facilitators so as to ensure consistency in approach, and balance across elements. We see this as an essential element in expediting our work, and improving the speed at which we comprehensively address the various sections within elements of the text.

We arrived in Bonn with a clear objective to engage in real substantive negotiations on key issues. The conversations we had with our partners here confirmed our assessment that the prospects for a deal in Paris are good and that there is strong political will to adopt a legally binding agreement that is applicable to all Parties and compatible with the below 2?C objective. However, we consider that progress in this session has been far too slow.

The Group of 77 and China is encouraged by the progress made to advance our work under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force to be adopted in Paris later this year, as well as the work to raise pre-2020 ambition. The Group also appreciates the cooperative and constructive spirit that Parties have demonstrated during this session of the ADP. We wish to thank you and the co-facilitators for patiently guiding us through the Geneva text to streamline and consolidate options. We are confident that although our progress here in Bonn has been modest, the time spent will allow us to accelerate the pace of negotiations at the next sessions of the ADP. It remains important that we engage in our work in an open, transparent, Party-driven and consensus building manner in order to provide all Parties with the assurances needed to secure an equitable and ambitious agreement in Paris. Co-Chairs, We now need to move forward with determination and urgency. The Group wishes to stress the importance of increasing the pace at which we work in the upcoming August meeting here in Bonn. In order to avoid a protracted procedural discussion, it is crucial to have absolute clarity on the way forward, including on the work you intend to undertake as Co-Chairs in the intersessional period, as well as on what we can expect to be the basis and mode of work when we come back to Bonn. The Group feels that it is important to enter into substantive negotiations without any further delay. In this regard the Group thanks you for the proposal you have made on the way forward. We support the proposal that the Co-Chairs prepare, with the support of the secretariat and the co-facilitators, a single document based on the structure of Annex II of your scenario note dated 5 May 2015. We are reassured that all Parties\\x19 proposals remain on the table as we move forward towards Paris. We wish to make clear our understanding that we regard the documents that have been produced here in Bonn, as well as the document you have indicated that you will present to Parties after this session to have the status only of non-papers. It is important that your document address the six core elements mandated by the Durban Platform decision in a comprehensive and balanced manner both in the agreement text and decision text, without prejudice to the Parties\\x19 proposals and would not prejudge the priority, sequencing and final placement of issues. With regard to your proposal to present Parties a document indicating what in your view should go in the Paris agreement and what will need to be dealt with in decisions, the Group wishes to stress the importance of addressing all the elements in the Durban Platform in both places in a comprehensive and balanced manner, preserving the structure of the Geneva text and taking into account that there are many issues that Parties believe should be addressed in the agreement, as well as in decisions. We also believe that you should keep in mind that there are certain issues for which it may be too early to make a determination regarding their proper placement. It is therefore important that we leave here with a clear understanding that your document will be without prejudice to Parties\\x19 right at our next sessions to propose that options, paragraphs, elements, etc. be moved. We wish to call on you again to create appropriate opportunities for Parties to reflect on the cross-cutting issues, such as scope, support, thematic parity, equity, differentiation, structure and legal form, at an appropriate time. This should not be a theoretical exercise, but rather take place in the context of specific text that Parties are working on. The Group once again wishes to remind you how important it is to allow for sufficient coordination time for groups. We believe that the process will benefit greatly if Parties can have the opportunity to iron out differences on specific issues where there are several different options in the text. Co-Chairs The Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre-2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP that has a direct bearing on the successful outcome of the Paris COP. We reiterate that Workstream II shall be treated in a balanced manner with Workstream I. The Group shares its concern on unbalanced progress between Workstream I and II in this session. We recognize that we have only 10 negotiating days until Paris. The G77 and China submission to advance our work We need to go beyond a compilation and advance to a textual negotiation as soon as possible. We request the co-chairs, with the co-facilitators and Secretariat to draft an inclusive paper based on: Parties submissions, interventions and presentations of their proposals made here in Bonn Facilitators outputs; Further submissions by parties intersionally Co Chairs, This should enable us to keep all of the options on the table and consider this new paper as a starting point, a basis of our discussions at ADP 2-10.

The African Group fully associates itself with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 plus China. As a group we reaffirm our confidence in your ability to facilitate an outcome that can be owned by all Parties. We further thank you for the diligent effort in the preparation of the \\x18tool\\x19 contained in your scenario note of 24 July 2015. The tool does help us Parties to work towards a basis for negotiation that Parties can own. We, however, note that a lot of work needs to be done in order to arrive at a text that our Ministers can consider in Paris. We would like to underline the importance of striving for balance in the text, Party ownership of our work, and the use of effective work methods. We have strong reservations on the text as presented in your tool, as well as the work methods proposed for this session. However, we place value in making best use of time available during this as such we would like to propose the following. Firstly, to achieve balance and provide an assurance to Parties that no ideas are off the table, it is important that we use this session to arrive at a text that can be considered by Parties as basis for negotiation, building on the co-chairs\\x19 tool. The co-chairs\\x19 proposal to address all three parts of the tool is quite important in this respect. We, however, understand that this exercise does not require a negotiation, rather an opportunity for Parties to clarify their placement considerations. This should restore the necessary balance in the text. Secondly, it is important that Parties own the process and the text, hence it is important for the co-chairs to create space for Parties to provide guidance on the work methods for this session. We note the importance of bilateral consultation of Parties and Groups of Parties with the co-chairs, however we do not see it as a substitute for solutions that emerge from engagement by Parties. In this respect, we propose that the co-chairs periodically convene head of delegation consultations, parallel to the facilitated discussions so that they can present their views on both the substance and progress in the negotiations, as well as consideration of mode of work proposed by the co-chairs, following bilateral consultations with various Groups of Parties. This is important for Parties to directly address each other\\x19s concerns. We would further propose that a similar meeting is convened in the morning of 2 September to take stock, as well as on the 4th of September, to reflect on co-chairs proposal for 4 September for the ADP 2-11. Lastly, to ensure effective work methods, it is our view that the co-chairs need to give a clear and consistent mandate to the co-facilitators so as to ensure that Parties can prepare meaningfully for the session, as well as take stock of progress across the different sections of the text. We welcome the proposed a mode of work where all Parts of the co-chairs\\x19 tool are dealt with simultaneously. Parties can also identify some areas which could be mechanically undertaken by the Secretariat under the guidance of the co-chairs, such as parts of section III and V of Part II could be merged into a single text, as they both pertain to the work necessary for the agreement to enter into force. Co-chairs, We would like to reiterate our Ministers\\x19 vision for the 2015 Agreement, where Africa envisions an agreement that, Will be under the Convention and in accordance with its principles and provisions in particular the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. Further enhance the implementation of the Convention and its Annexes, be consistent with science and equity, and further enhance a multilateral rules based system in a balanced and ambitious manner; Provides parity between mitigation and adaptation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries from inadequate aggregate mitigation efforts. Further, the agreement should ensure mitigation ambition keeps the world on track for global temperature increase that is well below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre- industrial levels by the end of the century; Operationalise of the global responsibility for adaptation, through a global goal for adaptation that enhances the implementation of adaptation commitments under the Convention, which recognise adaptation investments by developing countries, adaptation needs and costs including adequacy of support from developed countries. The Group reaffirms that loss and damage is very critical to the core agreement, so as the linkage between inadequate mitigation ambition with adaptation and loss and damage; Reaffirms the international obligation for all developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex II to provide climate finance to developing countries as a means to enhancing action towards achieving the objectives of the Convention. The Ministers further emphasised the importance of scaling-up financial resources for the period beyond 2020, as a deal in Paris would be impossible without clarity on this matter. Co-chairs, In relation to workstream II, we note the elements of a draft decision prepared by the workstream II co-facilitators. We believe this is a useful step in our work together but that much more work is required during this session to prepare an ambitious and comprehensive decision that fulfils the mandate under the Durban Platform. We remind Parties that our efforts under workstream II are to ??close the ambition gap with a view to ensuring the highest possible mitigation efforts by all Parties??.

We would like to associate ourselves with the statement delivered by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. AILAC welcomes your effort, together with the facilitators and the Secretariat, to provide the ADP with a tool that enables us to focus our discussions on the truly critical aspects that define the Paris package and deliver an effective, fair and durable outcome. This package must ensure that there is progression beyond exiting commitments as a necessary condition for enhanced ambition. The elements that are reflected in the Agreement must ensure its durability and comprehensively address all issues in a balanced manner. With this in mind, the Agreement must include an ambitious objective that catalyses action towards the achievement of a long term mitigation goal. A durable, ambitious agreement implies the establishment of nationally determined mitigation commitments, as well as commitments on adaptation, means of implementation and on transparency of action and support. Durability of this arrangement and the continuous enhancement of ambition is ensured by embedding short term, successive commitment cycles for nationally determined commitments that provide the certainty and predictability that Parties will continue to update and implement commitments into the future. A short\\x10term commitment cycle is the most effective way to create an agreement that is capable of triggering countries to frequently revisit and enhance their ambition, significantly increasingly the momentum towards reaching the objective of the Convention and the 2?C goal. These commitment cycles, as well as a specific long\\x10term emissions trajectory that reflect the latest recommendations of the IPCC, a definition of a long\\x10term qualitative goal on finance and a global adaptation goal will also be critical to securing an ambitious and durable agreement. The Agreement must reflect and address the linkage between mitigation ambition and adaptation, loss and damage, and means of implementation. This is a cross cutting element and acknowledging this linkage, allows for operationalizing enhanced mitigation ambition to reduce adaptation needs and associated costs. Adaptation is an issue that goes beyond the local dimension, and has global effects. This demands adaptation action to be undertaken as a commitment on behalf of all Parties in a successive and consistent manner and the provision of means of implementation for adaptation as an instrumental part of the achievement of global resilience enhancement and vulnerability reduction. AILAC strongly urges Parties to build on what we have done so far to improve the understanding of each other??s positions, so that this session in Bonn delivers the necessary inputs for an evolved version of a negotiating text before the October sessions.

Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for your diligent work since last session. We are prepared to use your negotiating \\x1ctool\\x1d to make further progress here. However, it is important for us to have more clarity on the specific modalities of work this week and the intended outcome of the session. Indeed, there is no time to waste. Just last week, NASA released findings that show the world may already be locked into one metre of sea level rise\\x14putting many small islands and low-lying coastal states at risk for severe flooding if not total inundation by the end of the century. We also saw Tropical Storm Erika\\x19s travel a deadly path through Dominica in the Caribbean and, of course, the devastation wrought by Cyclone Pam and Typhoon Maysak as they passed through Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and FSM earlier this year will not soon be forgotten. Co-Chairs, Such extreme weather events are happening in the context of an average global temperature increase of less than 1 degree C, reminding us that without bold and very urgent action, far worse is yet to come. This inescapable reality should add urgency to our work and inform the agreement that we are developing for Paris. An ambitious and effective agreement must contain the following: First, with respect to mitigation, it is critical that a pathway to achieving below the 1.5 degree global goal is reflected in the Paris agreement. The agreement must do more than institute a new process; it must also deliver outcomes and demand ambitious performance through internationally legally binding and quantified mitigation commitments that increase global ambition over successive commitment cycles. The agreement must be designed to limit global average temperature increase to well below 1.5 degrees C and the agreement\\x19s articles must operationalize the achievement of this objective Second, with respect to finance, we know that tackling climate change and adapting to its impacts will require a minimum of $100 billion USD per year by 2020. Developed countries must deliver on this commitment and further commit to scale up the provision of support beyond 2020 if we are to realise the level of ambition required to avert the worst impacts of climate change. It is also essential to maintaining trust in the process. Unfortunately we are still a long way short of this climate finance goal to which we agreed in Cancun. Third, with respect to loss and damage, we are now experiencing impacts from human- induced climate change that cannot be addressed through adaptation, such as those from accelerating sea level rise and increasing ocean acidification. To effectively manage these, an international mechanism to address loss and damage must be a central element of the Paris agreement. The Warsaw decision and the IPCC 5th Assessment Report acknowledge that loss and damage results when climate impacts exceed the limits of our adaptation measures. Loss and damage should be treated as a separate and distinct element of the agreement, and the mechanism defined under this agreement should be mandated to initiate a process to address irreversible and permanent damage. An agreement that purports to take meaningful action, while failing to address the central concerns of SIDS, equates to having no\"'],\n",

Co-Chairs, We thank you for the efforts that you made during your meetings with the various groups and during informal ministerial meetings, and we thank you for the memorandum you issued during the past month, which includes the work methodology to be followed during this stage, as well as the mechanism for dealing with the Geneva text. Referring to the content of this mechanism and the method of work during this tour, the Arab Group would like to express the following: First, the proposed mechanism does not constitute a basis or reference for discussion, and we affirm the parties\\' right to review the texts and classification as consistent with their positions. Second - The mechanism, as proposed, is neither balanced nor comprehensive, nor consistent with the primary objective of the Durban Resolution. We have also indicated that the mechanism is biased towards introducing new concepts and ideas that are in the aggregate of mitigation and strong legal formulation, at the expense of adaptation and support means. Third - The outputs from informal ministerial meetings and meetings outside the technical negotiating track of the Durban curriculum should not overlap with the negotiating track and not affect the conditions surrounding the negotiations. Fourth - The performance of the meeting heads concerned with the different parts of the agreement must be evaluated and the necessity of correcting their method of work to prevent imposition Presidents\\' positions and their own agenda. Fifth- We would like to focus on the importance of transparency and inclusiveness for all parties as necessary to ensure the fairness and success of the negotiations.

We fully associate ourselves with the statement of the Group of 77 and China. Co?Chairs, We reaffirm that the process and outcome of ADP should be guided by and be in full accordance with all principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. The 2015 agreement shall address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate ? mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity?building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support. An ambitious outcome of the ADP should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner. In this session, we should focus on the core provisions to be included in the agreement, including all core elements of the Durban mandate. Further detailing of the provisions, including modalities and technical aspects, could be addressed in COP decisions, as agreed by Parties. We reiterate that commitments under the agreement must be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Parties\\x19contributions will be nationally determined and reflect each Party\\x19s highest possible effort, in accordance with its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Contributions should be comprehensive, addressing, mitigation, adaptation and the provision of support by developed to developing countries. We believe that ambition and effectiveness will be achieved by maintaining differentiation among developed and developing country Parties in each element of the agreement. This will enhance participation and efforts by all countries. With regard to the Workstream 2, the pre\\x102020 ambition gap shall be primarily addressed through the implementation of the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the outcome of the Bali Action Plan. We are concerned with the inadequacy of developed countries\\x19 current commitments on emission reductions and provision of financial and technological support.

This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. The Environmental Integrity Group would like to express its solidarity with the people of Dominica, Haiti and neighboring countries who have been hit by Hurricane Erika. The number of such tragedies is increasing while we are negotiating ? dear colleagues, let us work together during this and the forthcoming ADP sessions and make everything we can to avoid an increase of natural disasters caused by climate change! Not the number of victims should get higher, but the ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our efforts to ensure resilience and reduce vulnerability. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear friends and colleagues. The EIG delegations have arrived here in Bonn committed to make together with all of you a significant step forward towards a comprehensive and effective outcome in Paris which includes a legally binding instrument containing the enduring elements of the 2015 Agreement, COP decisions with dynamic and technical elements, and nationally determined commitments and engagements for the period beyond 2020. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement needs to address all relevant areas: mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency of action and support. We would like to thank the Co-Chairs for the tool they have developed based on the Geneva text and the discussions of our last session. This compilation is a useful step towards an agreement but we share the views of others that this tool is not sufficient, that it has many important gaps, inconsistencies and duplications. But: the tool gives us a good idea how the Geneva Negotiation Text could be structured into an agreement and COP decisions. Therefore, it can be very helpful for our discussions and negotiations. But it can only be useful if we use it in the proper manner: as a tool and not as a negotiation text. Rather than moving the elements from one section to another, we have to use the tool as a basis to decide what belongs into the legally binding agreement and what belongs in COP decisions. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear colleagues, time is running out. We have to speed up. We have now to engage in a positive and constructive manner. Time is short. But this does not mean that we have to add additional time. We have to use the time in an efficient and effective manner. If we work constructively, if we work in a solution oriented manner, then the remaining time is sufficient. If we do this throughout this week, then we have created the basis to develop a fully consolidated, streamlined, clear and concise negotiation text. We must be efficient in the use of the ten negotiation days that remain until COP 21. Mr. Co-Chairs, colleagues, the EIG has submitted several times its views and proposal on the substance, form and structure of the Paris outcome. This is not the moment to repeat this, but rather to move rapidly into work and most importantly into active interaction and engagement. We are looking forward to do this together with all our partners here. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"'],\n",

The conversations we have had with our partners in various fora since we last met in June have confirmed our assessment that the prospects for a deal in Paris are good. There is clear and strong political will to adopt a legally binding agreement that is applicable to all Parties and that is compatible with the below 2?C objective. We welcome the progress made at various recent ministerial discussions and look forward to progress at negotiator level now quickly following suit. With only 10 negotiating days before we meet in Paris, we need to use our remaining time to best effect. It is imperative for all Parties to engage in real negotiations with our partners. In that context we welcome the efforts of the co-Chairs, and the help of the co-facilitators, to produce their \\'tool\\'. While there are aspects of the tool that are significantly problematic for the EU \\x13 both in terms of substance and placement - we are broadly in support of the approach outlined in the scenario note. It is crucial to start to converge on which aspects of the Paris outcome will be in the Paris Protocol, and which will be in the equally important supporting decisions. We also fully support the assertion in the scenario note that the time for making compromises and building bridges is now. It will also be essential to identify clear options for Ministerial guidance in relation to issues where agreement cannot be reached at negotiator level. We must make progress in the coming days on substance: Firstly on how the 2015 Agreement will deliver transparency and accountability of Parties\\' against their mitigation commitments. Secondly, on how to ensure dynamism in the 2015 Agreement, across all elements. For mitigation this means how to secure a process to regularly revisit and, if necessary, raise ambition over time to collectively achieve an agreed long term goal. Thirdly, on how to ensure that the 2015 Agreement contributes to achieving climate resilient sustainable development and reduction of vulnerability through effective adaptation. Fourthly, on how the post 2020 regime will provide support to those countries in need. In relation to raising mitigation ambition before 2020, we welcome the draft decision and that the co-Chairs have allocated time to address this important issue. We look forward in particular to strengthening high level political engagement on this issue in the coming years and appreciate the already expressed high-level support for the Lima-Paris Action Agenda. Finally we commend those Parties that have come forward with their INDCs since we last met. We urge others to follow and come forward with ambitious and clear INDCs, in particular, all major economies. All INDCs must be implemented through robust policies to prevent dangerous climate change which is the ultimate objective of the Convention. We also note the large variety of the INDCs already presented. \"'],\n",

The Group also wishes to thank you for preparing the Non-Paper as a tool to guide our work during this session. Firstly, Co-Chairs, the Group believes that we need to accelerate the pace of our work if we are to successfully fulfil our mandate from Durban by the end of this year. However, in order to make progress, we need more clarity on the process at this session and the desired outcome. In this regard, the Group is of the view that we need a negotiating text from this session to be the basis of further work. To achieve this, the process we follow must prioritise balance, party ownership and effective working methods. Although the clustering of issues is helpful in focusing our attention to the key issues that will need to be resolved, the Group is of the view that the manner in which many issues have been placed has resulted in the document being unbalanced. Many issues such as principle of CBDR, linkage between action by developing country Parties and support by developed country Parties, institutions on adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, loss and damage, response measures and scope of contributions, which are important to the Group are now found in Part III, creating the impression that there is doubt about whether they need to be included in the agreement, or that they may be too controversial or difficult to be agreed on in Paris at all. The Paris outcome must not be mitigation-centric and must address all the elements mandated by the Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures in a balanced manner. To make progress here in Bonn, it is very important that we gain clarity on the mandate and working methods of the facilitators, which must be consistent across the different sections. Parties should also seek to exchange views with each other, not just with the Co- Chairs and facilitators, as this process is and should remain a Party-driven process. In order to ensure that the engagement between Parties is constructive, the Group needs to be given sufficient time and opportunity to coordinate its positions. At the previous session evening coordination was turned into negotiation time, which has hampered the ability of our Group to work on consolidating our proposals. Therefore when the Group requests additional coordination time, we trust that it will be understood. Co-Chairs The G77 also firmly believes that progress on pre-2020 ambition is crucial for the success of Paris and will lay a solid foundation for the implementation and ambition of post-2020 enhanced action. Not only do we need to have sufficient time-slots to work on the elements for a draft decision on Workstream II, but the sessions devoted to this work should not take place in parallel with Workstream I sessions where the relevant experts are involved. The Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre-2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP mandate that has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. Workstream II is essentially about accelerating the implementation of existing commitments and obligations and ways to promote enhanced ambition. Progress in Workstream II will be critical for an agreement in Paris. We look forward to engaging constructively and proactively and making significant progress on the Workstream II decision at this session. Finally, we would like to thank all the contributing Parties that have provided resources for this meeting and appeal for additional resources to be allocated for future meetings, in a way that supports the adequate representation of delegates from developing countries. At this meeting many delegations are handicapped due to their being underrepresented. All efforts must be made to leave no-one behind. Finally, the Group wishes to make it clear that the UNFCCC process is the only forum where the negotiations on the Paris outcome can take place. Thank you. \"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We express our deep condolences to the people of Dominica who are currently facing devastating floods. Co-Chairs, we started our journey in the ADP in Durban almost four years ago and are now three months away from when we must adopt an outcome in Paris. This agreed outcome must all the six core elements from the Durban mandate in a balanced manner both in the agreement and the COP decision and reflect the principles and provisions of the Convention particularly the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Such outcome must result in enhanced action in the context of sustainable development in implementing the UNFCCC both before and after 2020. Our process at this session and all the way up to Paris must be open, transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensus- building, marked by direct negotiations among the Parties on the basis of texts that they have produced themselves. Only through this process will the Paris conference have a successful and legitimate outcome. In this regards, we appreciate your efforts to prepare the tool for this session but share our concern on the tool in terms of the unbalanced treatment among different elements of the Geneva text. Co-Chairs, while we face multiple challenges in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication, the countries of the LMDC have undertaken ambitious domestic actions on climate change including on mitigation and adaptation, and in surmounting the losses and damages arising from climate change-related natural disasters, while pursuing various sustainable development pathways and eradicating poverty. However, as has been most recently seen just a few days ago when Tropical Storm Erika hit Dominica, a single climate-related disaster can set back our development progress by years or decades. Nevertheless, we will and can do more of these climate actions now, up to and beyond 2020, but doing so will need increased levels of international cooperation from our developed country partners through increasing ambition on their commitments to drastically reduce their emissions and to provide additional, adequate and predictable levels of finance, development and transfer of technology and know-how, and capacity-building support to developing countries. We call on developed countries to do more to honor and fulfill their obligations under the Convention ? to be more ambitious on mitigation and to provide and substantially enhance financial support, technology and know-how development and transfer, and capacity building support for developing countries to adequate and predictable levels in support of developing countries\\' climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. Co-Chairs, we have proactively and constructively put forward textual proposals that reflect the best way through which the Convention\\x19s implementation will be fully, effectively and sustainably enhanced before and after 2020, in which the Convention\\x19s principles, provisions, and structure are fully respected and reflected in a way that is in full accordance with the differentiated obligations and commitments of developed and developing countries, and is consistent with Article 4 of the Convention. Increasing ambition includes holistically reflecting the integrated treatment of mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to developing country Parties. The Paris outcome must also incorporate a meaningful approach to address the adverse impacts of response measures. Whether the Paris outcome is ambitious and could be implemented in a sustained manner depends on whether it is consistent with the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention. The key convergence among Parties is that the Paris outcome must be under the Convention and should enhance action on the implementation of the Convention in order to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. It is not to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or replace the Convention or reinterpret its principles and provisions. The concepts or approaches such as \\x1cevolving CBDR\\x1d, \\x1cParties in a position to do so\\x1d, \\x1csingle transparency system\\x1d or \\x1cmitigation-centric cycle\\x1d are not consistent with the principles of the Convention and are not acceptable. Therefore these concepts must be removed from the text. Co-Chairs, we stress that Parties\\' INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 must be consistent with the Parties\\x19 respective obligations and commitments under Article 4 of the Convention. In this context, we are extremely disappointed that the INDCs that have so far been communicated by developed country Parties are mitigation-centered only on post-2020 emission reduction targets and do not contain any post-2020 commitments, policies and measures for the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to developing countries. We stress that the INDCs by developing country Parties on post-2020 enhanced action, including as appropriate, mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage are to be prepared, communicated and implemented in the context of achieving sustainable development and the implementation of Article 4.7 of the Convention. Co-Chairs, pre-2020 ambition should be primarily achieved through the implementation of the outcomes of the Bali Roadmap. Therefore, accelerating the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw COP decision 1/CP.19 and paragraph 17 and 18 of the Lima Call for Climate Action (decision 1/CP.20) must be the priority of the pre-2020 outcomes in Paris.

It is important to highlight that this Convention prides itself on basing its actions on science. Various and well-known scientific investigations published in the course of last July and this August present concurrent evidence that the levels and rates of temperature increases, melting of polar ice and increases in sea level are occurring much earlier than anticipated, with catastrophic effects for food security, water availability, biodiversity and the very survival of communities, particularly the coastal ones, and indigenous peoples around the planet. This being the case, it is important for the SICA countries, currently impacted by a severe drought, that within these negotiations the increase in temperature of 2?C above the existing average in the era is not maintained as an immovable goal within the new protocol. pre industrial. The presidents and heads of state of the SICA countries agreed that a maximum increase of 1.5?C in temperature is more consistent with the findings of science and the already observed effects of climate change, when we have not yet reached 1 degree increase. The SICA countries consider that an increase in emissions reduction ambitions is necessary to achieve this goal, especially in developed countries. Likewise, the initiative of Conservation of tropical forests and REDD + can contribute substantively. Ladies and Gentlemen Co-presidents, given the aforementioned effects of climate change already observed, as well as the trends to acceleration and intensification in which the aforementioned scientific research converges, make it imperative that the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, strengthened and endowed of the appropriate financial resources, be an integral part of the legally binding instrument, protocol or agreement designed to respond to the realities already present and the immediate future that climate change presents. The impacts of climate change will be felt much more intensely on countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, such as those on the African continent, small island states, least developed countries, those located in interoceanic strips such as those of SICA, among others. These and other adverse effects will have severe impacts on economic growth and increases in poverty, seriously compromising their possibilities and their right to development. Therefore, tendencies to restrict climate finance only to those in greater poverty represent an inappropriate approach, which could have serious and costly repercussions in relatively short periods. Compromising or even limiting the capacity to fulfill the commitments that these countries may adopt in the framework of INDCs. Ladies and gentlemen co-chairs, we must recognize that we are still a long way from achieving the level of ambition necessary to achieve the objective of the Convention in all the required areas: mitigation, adaptation, financing, development and transfer of technology and capacity building. And we are far from the majority of countries in the world having conditions to increase the scale of compliance and implementation of the commitments that are expected to be assumed within the new agreement or protocol. If we do not take advantage of the pre-2020 period as an opportunity to accelerate implementation, to close the growing mitigation gap and create the conditions that allow all the countries of the world to have the appropriate capacities, resources and experiences, to fulfill those commitments from 2021, the new protocol will have serious limitations. This is why it is vitally important for a robust and balanced agreement in Paris that developed countries show the leadership that is required and expected of them within the Convention in the line of work or ??workstream 2??. Finally, in order for the new legal instrument, protocol or agreement with legal force to have the structure that allows it to be effectively and appropriately balanced in fulfilling the objective of the Convention, it must integrate with parity of political and legal importance all the elements recorded in the decision. 1/CP.17, from the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action: Mitigation, Adaptation, Financing, Technology Development and Transfer, Capacity Building and Transparency in Action and Support.

              "       ['153,2,10,10,20150904,eu,\"Dear Co?Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We arrived in Bonn with a clear objective to engage in substantive negotiations on key Issues. The conversations we had with our partners here confirmed our assessment that the prospects for a deal in Paris are still good and that there is strong political will to adopt a legally binding agreement that is applicable to all Parties and compatible with the below 2 degrees Celsius objective. However, while some of the spinoffs have seen Parties really engaging in the substance of the issues and while we had very constructive discussions here, our pace is still too slow to arrive at the substantial, ambitious agreement we all want, that is accompanied by clear decisions and a work programme for the years up to 2020. We need to accelerate the speed of negotiations and to that end we need a new, real basis for our deliberations. To create this basis, we think the co?chairs have all the material they need. They can capture progress achieved here, based on the views of Parties expressed, the working documents and outputs from the facilitated groups and spin offs, and produce a concise, coherent and consistent negotiating text which covers the agreement as well as substantial supporting decisions. To use the few negotiation days left before Paris well, we need this text to reflect areas of common ground, based on proposals that genuinely bridge areas of substance that have divided parties in the past, and be available as soon as possible ahead of the October session. The text needs to contain clear political options to be resolved at ministerial and higher level, and many Ministers have already provided political guidance as well as urged us to accelerate the negotiations. We would like the co?chairs to be courageous and produce, together with the help of the secretariat, and the co?facilitators, such a text as soon as possible. Clearly all Parties in this room have expressed the need for you, dear co?chairs, to produce that text so that we can begin serious negotiations the moment we arrive again in Bonn. We welcome the progress in discussions on how to raise mitigation ambition before 2020, where we feel that a substantial decision can be achieved in Paris. We were pleased to attend the INDC session and hear more information about how Parties elaborate and address their INDCs, as well as following the preview on the synthesis report that the secretariat gave today. We look forward to the full synthesis report to be presented, and the lessons it will doubtlessly contain to improve the text of the Paris agreement. We welcome that since we have been here in Bonn, more Parties have come forward with INDCs. We urge others to follow and come forward, in particular, those major economies that have not yet presented their INDCs. In summary, we feel that clarity on concepts and options, including ideas of how to bridge positions, has been achieved at this session and that this needs to be captured by what the co?Chairs produce next. We would like to thank the co?Chairs for their leadership and guidance and the co?facilitators, the spin off group leads and the Secretariat for their hard work. We wish our friends and colleagues a safe journey home and look forward to working together again in October, and succeeding together, by Paris, to produce an agreement to preserve our children and their children, from climate change and its devastating consequences, while harvesting the many co?benefits for our development and economies that climate action entails. \"'],\n",
              "       ['154,2,10,10,20150904,g77china,\"Co-Chairs I have the honour to make these remarks on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. At the outset, I wish to assure you that the Group is committed to make progress in our negotiations under the ADP. We have expressed in our stocktaking meeting on Wednesday the concern of the Group with the pace of the progress and the need for an urgent step-change in our process. As a Group, we have engaged constructively with our partners here in Bonn. However, we need to take on board the lessons we have learned at this session. There has been fragmentation of the process with the proliferation of spin-off groups. This, along with lack of clear instructions to the facilitators, which led to inconsistency in approaches followed in the different groups, have often overwhelmed and disadvantaged delegations from developing countries that are small. Having said that, it is essential that the progress we have made during this session is captured. Textual proposals made by Parties, the results of the facilitation and spin- off groups, proposals for bridging text and clarification of concepts, should be captured as milestones in order to ensure Party ownership of the process. Co-Chairs Real textual negotiations must start at the October session. For this purpose, a manageable text that is negotiable is needed. In order to achieve this, the Group wishes to give clear guidance to the Co-Chairs on how to proceed. This text must be based on the Geneva text, building on the Co-Chairs Tool and the inputs made by the Parties at this session. For Workstream I, this means a text of the draft agreement with accompanying decisions. The text must be coherently structured, properly ordered and include all the elements that Parties need to see reflected in the agreement. It must also be clear, streamlined, consolidated, simplified and balanced, presenting clear and crystalised options on all elements. Many issues that need to be contained in a decision also need a hook in the agreement and a purely binary approach is not appropriate. For Workstream II, a revised text of the decision, capturing the work done at this session is required. These texts must be made available inter-sessionally as soon as possible to enable for Parties to properly prepare for negotiations in October in order to allow textual negotiations to start immediately in the October session. At the end of the October session, we need to have a text with clearly identified political options on elements of divergence and convergence in order prepare our principals properly for Paris. Co-Chairs We need an effective method of work going forward. The Group believes that this entails a greater degree of centralisation in the management of the process. In this regard, there is a need to engage on an on-going basis during the session on cross- cutting issues and interlinkages in a central place. The utilisation of facilitation groups with clear and consistent instructions to the facilitators that consider specific issues can be very helpful to capture progress. Regular meetings with the Heads of Delegations should be used to inform Parties on the overall status of the negotiations. Stocktaking meeting at appropriate moments in the process could be helpful and should not be regarded as a waste of time. The multilateral, Party-driven process must be honoured. Parties must be able to negotiate and discuss with each other directly and not through the Co-Chairs bilaterally. Finally, Co-Chairs, we wish to assure you of our continued support and trust in your leadership to manage and guide us to a successful outcome in Paris. Thank you \"'],\n",
              "       ['155,2,11,11,20151019,ag,\"Co-chairs, the Republic of Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. The African Group fully associates itself with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 plus China. As a group we recognize your facilitation efforts to fulfil the Durban mandate to adopt a legal agreement, no later than 2015. We recall our mandate as adopting a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, applicable to all. Co-chairs, we recall the mandate from ADP 2-10 for you, co-chairs, to prepare a negotiating text, building from the Geneva Text and submissions by Parties made in both the ADP 2-9 and ADP 2-10. We take note of the non-paper ADP.2015.8.Informal Note, which did provide a manageable text for Parties to consider. We would, however, wish to express that the non-paper cannot serve as a basis for negotiation, as it is not balanced and does not reflect concerns of the African Group and a number of other developing countries. Co-chairs, we assessed this text on the basis of the guidance we received from the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) in their key messages from a meeting they held on the 25 September 2015. And it is our sense that all red-lines that our leaders expressed are being crossed by your proposed text. We see the text, at best, as weak attempt to a \\x18compromise text\\x19, rather than a text that could serve as a \\x18basis for negotiation\\x19. We understand a basis for negotiation as a text that reflects views and concepts from all Parties in options that can be negotiated. Co-chairs, we would like to reflect on some of the key red-lines that are crossed on the text. Firstly, this Agreement is to be concluded under the Convention, and shall be interpreted in accordance with its objectives, and principles and provisions. It is therefore concerning that there is no reference to equity, and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities is not operationalised in the text. Secondly, the proposed text does not reflect the necessary multilateral processes in respect of adequacy of mitigation, adaptation, and support to ensure consistency with the temperature goal. Thirdly, the text does not provide instructive action on mitigation; it is weaker in key respects than the Convention we agreed 20 years ago, and offers optional platitudes on adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building. Co-chairs, the African Group has always been constructive in taking our negotiations forward, as we are a block that needs a fair and effective multilateral agreement more than any other. We believe that the outcome from Paris must strengthen the rules-based multilateral system. As such, the provisions of the Convention serve as a baseline against which there is to be no backsliding. We do not believe that it is impossible to arrive at an outcome of ADP 2-11 that is balanced, fair and that reflects different views of Parties, and as such can serve a basis for negotiation. To establish such a basis, it is important for Parties to restore the balance by bracketing some of the \\x18clean text\\x19, and insert their options. It is only once all views are reflected as options in the text that we can indeed ascertain that we have a basis for negotiation. Co-chairs, the African Group is of the view that such insertions do not take us back to the Geneva Text, but rather restore balance and consistency with the Convention. The assurance we can provide is, a first point of call where Parties either bracket some of the current text or insert some words that reflect their views. The second point of call is for Parties to propose alternative paragraphs that contain options of other Parties in brackets. The last option is a complete presentation of alternatives to an Article, for example the G77 plus China presented a complete option on adaptation, finance, and loss and damage which, if re-inserted, would establish the balance. Co-chairs, we envisage a process where all such insertions can be undertaken live on screen during the first reading of the open-ended drafting committee. On completion of the insertions in each of the Articles, without negotiation, spin-off groups for such Articles can commence with their work immediately. The African Group will not engage in the spin-off groups on the basis of an unbalanced text. It is further our view that we have daily stock- taking meetings so as to have a clear view of how the negotiation is progressing in both the open-ended drafting committee and the spin-offs. It is the fulfilment of this proposal that would allow us to leave ADP 2-11 with what could be the basis for negotiation. On Workstream 2, co-chairs, we are disappointed at how the African Group and G77 and China proposal, including with regards to adaptation has been addressed in the non-paper. We recognise the additions that have been made to the text relating to the technical examination process on mitigation, and reference to the ??co-champions??. At the same time, between the last draft (prepared by the co-facilitators) and the current non-paper, we have seen removal of references in the preamble to strengthening implementation of the Convention, and the reference to the technical examination process on adaptation has been moved out of the operative text into text that is ??subject to further discussion??. The document, in this respect, has become weaker not s\"'],\n",
              "       ['156,2,11,11,20151019,ailac,\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Fellow Delegates. I have the honor to submit this statement on behalf of the AILAC group of countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama?, Paraguay and Peru. Allow us to associate ourselves with the statement submitted by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co?Chairs, We have arrived at the final lead-up to our ultimate landing milestone: CoP 21 in Paris next December. It has been a long, complex and enriching journey for us all, made up of many stages that hold true testimony to the everlasting importance of the task at hand, the success of which can only be guaranteed by a shared conviction that only through collective ambition and action shall we implement effective commitments that produce tangible results in the global fight against the threats of climate change. The legally binding agreement and decisions that come out of Paris must above all be durable and comprehensive addressing all dimensions of the global challenge that climate change poses to present and future generations, with balanced commitments for all Parties. We have called many times, together with many of our partners, for your support in arriving at a manageable instrument for negotiations, that encompasses all issues that have been discussed over the past months and years, capturing the foundations of the extensive conceptual discussions that we have had, in an effort to bring the multiple existing positions together underpinned by our call for an ambitious, durable and fair agreement. Coming to the dawn of the ADP Process here at ADP 2-11 we have been presented by you with an instrument. Bearing in mind the need to use the little remaining time we have left in the most focused and efficient manner possible, we hope for a day of concise interventions that signal the critical gaps in the text that need to be filled, and for a new text that can be the starting point of the negotiations tomorrow. Co-Chairs, Fellow delegates, AILAC stresses the need for ambition to be the underpinning principle that guides our work. A durable, ambitious agreement implies not only the establishment of nationally determined mitigation commitments, and adaptation and means of implementation efforts, but also assurance that they will be implemented. In doing so, we are renewing the way in which the multilateral system can catalyse national action, by means of defining nationally determined contributions that Parties themselves are putting forward as commitments to be carried out under a multilateral agreement. The durability of this agreement and the continuous enhancement of ambition will be ensured by embedding short term, successive commitment cycles for nationally determined commitments that provide the certainty and predictability that Parties will continue to update and implement commitments into the future, specifically every 5 years for mitigation NDCs. A short-term commitment cycle is the most effective way to create an agreement that is capable of triggering countries to frequently revisit and enhance their ambition, significantly increasingly the momentum towards staying below the 2?C temperature increase and any other long-term emissions reduction goals decided by Parties in Paris. For AILAC, it is critical that the agreement go beyond the global temperature goal agreed in Cancun and establish a quantified, long-term trajectory, as recommended by the latest science, that will help guide Parties and signal non-state actors to collectively reach net zero emissions by the end of the century, according to the national development capabilities. Basic accounting rules for mitigation NDCs must also be included in the agreement as a way to ensure the environmental integrity and effectiveness of the agreement. It has also become clear that the definition of a collective quantitative goal for scaling up the mobilization of finance is critical to enhance the ambition and durability of the Paris outcome. Specific commitments to reach $100 billion per year in mobilized climate finance by 2020 and scale it up further in the post-2020 period are critical for the effective implementation of the Agreement. Additionally, the agreement must include an effective, robust transparency system that builds on existing arrangements under the Convention and ensures frequent and robust reporting and review of information to track progress of action and support, with the support needed for developing countries to do so. AILAC countries welcome the INDCs from nearly 150 Parties that have been presented over the past few months, reflecting Parties that represent nearly 90% of GHG emissions, which lay the foundations for enhanced action in the post-2020 period. We emphasize the need for those contributions to be clear, transparent and understandable and to respect the principles of non- back sliding on existing commitments, targets and actions under the Convention. The Paris Agreement must be shaped in a manner that addresses the fundamental linkage between mitigation efforts, adaptation and loss and damage and the corresponding need for means of implementation. The Global Stocktake that shall periodically track the successive commitments on all issues must recognize the linkage so that the underpinning ambition on all fronts ensures the delivery of aggregate long-term goals that effectively tackle the causes and adverse impacts of climate change. The High Level Sessions on Mitigation, Adaptation and Climate Finance shall build on the outputs resulting from such a Stocktake process, in a manner that catalyses implementation of national action oriented towards the achievement of agreed global goals. An equitable and fair agreement must include Loss and Damage, a reality this is already affecting countries and will become more pressing if sufficient mitigation ambition is not achieved. Therefore Loss and Damage must be adequately recognized and reflected in the agreement, including various institutional arrangements necessary to fully ad\"'],\n",
              "       ['157,2,11,11,20151019,alba,\"Co-presidents, I have the honor to make this intervention on behalf of the members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the peoples of our America - ALBA: Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Dominica and others. The peoples of the five continents of the world, Heads of State of ALBA, Ministers, authorities, and personalities, we met in Tiquipaya-Bolivia a few days ago to listen to his message in order to preserve life against the adverse effects of climate change and in response to the failed capitalist system and an irrational civilizing model that is the structural cause of the climate crisis in the world that has broken the balance with Mother Earth and has generated an ecological debt, with a social repercussion that falls mainly on the countries in developing. The peoples of the world demand climate justice and ask to adopt a new civilizational model, building a plural world that defends the universal common goods and the rights of Mother Earth, putting science at the service of humanity, incorporating ancient knowledge and practices, allocating the resources of the military machinery of the countries that promote war to finance the actions of the peoples against the climate crisis. The peoples of the world are calling for the impunity of developed countries to end and they urgently demand that they fulfill their commitments. For the climate agreement to be legitimate, it must be based on a holistic vision that reflects the concerns of the peoples and their subsistence in the face of the threats posed by the adverse effects of climate change. The responsibility of the States for the legitimate concerns of the peoples cannot be ignored by trying to transfer it to the private sector and, in particular, to the interests of transnational corporations. The eyes of the world are upon us, and we must work on an agreement that really allows us to improve the implementation of the Convention as the basis for the search for formulas for a fair approach to Climate Change. It is not just about what to do, but how to do it in a way that responds to common but differentiated responsibilities and does not deepen the inequities that affect countries and social groups. We need a fair and strong agreement, which establishes clear commitments for those responsible for history and means of implementation for climate actions in developing countries in the context of sustainable development, without compromising our priorities, in particular the eradication of poverty and our right to development. A party-driven process is much more than a name and the application of a few formal rules. A process guided by the parties depends on the respect among its members and the reliability and impartiality of its institutions. The presentation of an unbalanced document that excludes the positions of developing countries generates a deep wound in this process. It would seem that norms are used to exclude the weakest, rhetoric to hide truths, the art of the word to confuse. We must remember that this process has produced throughout our negotiations many texts that cannot be ignored and that we are not starting from scratch, we are building an agreement that must be firmly aligned with our Convention, its objective, its principles and provisions. We ALBA countries support the call that Bolivia made for the Second Summit of the Peoples on Climate Change because only the people saved the people, and we consider important the approaches that took place in the celebration of this significant conference for the debates that it is having place in the framework of the Convention on the occasion of the negotiation of the Paris agreement. Likewise, we consider it important that participation spaces are considered for the representatives of the different social movements of the world so that their voices and ideas can have a place in this initiative for the salvation of life on the Planet. These are the ten actions in defense of life and against the climate crisis resulting from Tiquipaya: TEN ACTIONS IN DEFENSE OF LIFE AND AGAINST CLIMATE CRISIS Adopt a new civilizational model in the world, without consumerism, war and commercialism, a world without capitalism that is the main cause of the climate crisis and poverty; launching decolonizing and depatriarcalizing processes and recognizing Living Well as the true alternative to the global crisis of the capitalist system. Strengthen the consciousness, vision and unity of peoples, and universal citizenship, building a plural world with inter-scientific, intercultural, inter-religious and inter-spiritual dialogue. We all form a \\x1ccommon family\\x1d, we defend \\x1cthe common house\\x1d and we are children of a single \\x1ccommon mother\\x1d, Mother Earth. Defend the universal commons: the seas and oceans, water, access to atmospheric space, life and communication technologies, as rights of all those raised by Mother Earth, promoting access and participation of peoples in the use of the common heritage. Put climate sciences at the service of all living beings and Mother Earth, strengthening the development of holistic and integral approaches that incorporate the knowledge, practices, knowledge and visions of the sciences of the western world and the ancestral and cultural sciences, creating spaces for dialogue and inter-scientific action. Allocate the resources of the military machinery of all the countries that promote war, to finance the actions of the peoples against the climate crisis. Form a Permanent International Platform of the peoples of the world, where the struggles for Mother Earth and their rights come together, invigorating the communal and community energy. Demand that the countries of the world assume their responsibility with our sacred Mother Earth, guaranteeing that they comply with their international commitments and obligations so as not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius on the planet, through a carbon budget. To do this, we must establish the International Tribunal for Climate Justice and Mother Earth with full participation and representation of the peoples. Eliminate the debts of developing countries to eradicate poverty and hunger, because debts are mechanisms of domination and oppression that through international financial usury profit with misery, particularly those debts that have attacked the common heritage of the peoples. Countries must strengthen mutual agreements of complementarity and solidarity and not of enslaving indebtedness. Mother Earth is dying.

We fully associate ourselves with the statement of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, We are deeply concerned with the slow pace of negotiations given the limited amount of negotiating time left before COP21 in Paris. In this regard, we appreciate the co-chairs\\' efforts in preparing the non-papers on \\x18Draft Agreement and Decision\\' and Workstream 2 draft decision as well as the scenario note of this session. However, we are very disappointed to find that the non-papers prepared by the co-chairs is inequitable and lacks balance. In particular, the non-papers departs or dilutes the principles and provisions of the Convention, and the current drafts is weakening rather than enhancing the implementation of the Convention. Both developed and developing countries are all treated in a like manner in the draft agreement, totally wiping out any notion of historical responsibilities and equity. Co-chairs, We are of the firm view that a good text containing a basis for negotiation must be comprehensive, balanced and capture the positions of Parties reflected during the negotiations without prejudging or interpreting the emergence of convergences. The documents should include clear options reflecting different views from Parties on all key issues. We also call for text-based negotiations at this session in an inclusive, open, transparent and Party-driven negotiating process. We reaffirm that the process and outcome of ADP should be guided by and be in full accordance with all principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. The 2015 agreement shall address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate?mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support. An ambitious outcome of the ADP should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner. We reiterate that commitments under the agreement must be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. We believe that ambition and effectiveness will be achieved by maintaining differentiation among developed and developing country Parties in each element of the agreement. This will enhance participation and efforts by all countries. With regard to the Workstream 2, the pre-2020 ambition gap shall be primarily addressed through the implementation of the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the outcome of the Bali Action Plan. We are concerned with the inadequacy of developed countries??current commitments on emission reductions and provision of financial and technological support.

This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. We would like to thank the Co-Chairs for the draft Agreement and draft decision that you have developed based on the views and inputs from Parties. In these drafts, many issues fall short from what the EIG seeks Paris to deliver. What we need is a legally binding and enduring Agreement that will set an effective and fair basis for global climate action and that will foster cooperation and increase in ambition in light of the recommendations of latest science. To ensure such an effective global response to climate change, the EIG calls for strengthening the current drafts. Particularly, regarding the following: In the area of mitigation, we need a legal obligation by all Parties to regularly communicate nationally determined commitments/contributions. The Agreement should provide further clarity on internationally transferrable mitigation outcomes. Furthermore, we need to include provisions to ensure environmental integrity and avoid double counting in using the mitigation outcomes. In the area of adaptation, we need a legal obligation by all Parties to engage in national adaptation planning, which is also nationally determined. We need a common and robust transparency system that provides flexibility and reflects Parties differentiated capacities. Enhanced reporting will be crucial for understanding the emission developments of Parties and their progress towards the implementation of their commitments/contributions. Co-Chairs, the stocktake provisions are extremely important and they should pertain to mitigation, adaptation and support. The EIG sees room for improving the current draft so that we are regularly able to assess the aggregate progress towards the achievement of the long term goals set for this agreement in a comprehensive and balanced manner. Mr. Co-Chairs, despite the shortcomings of the drafts, the EIG welcomes them as a basis for negotiation. They reflect the views from Parties and provide room to elaborate on the areas of convergence that we have reached so far between Parties. They are a succinct and workable basis for our further negotiations. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear colleagues, we have little time remaining before Paris. However, it is sufficient if we all engage in a constructive and solution oriented manner. The EIG is ready to find an effective and ambitious agreement and is ready to engage in meaningful negotiations in order to achieve significant progress in this session.

              "       ['161,2,11,11,20151019,eu,\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. We thank the co-Chairs for the bold step they have taken in responding to calls to produce a text that is concise, clear and coherent. We particularly welcome the structure of the text, and the way in which key issues relating to mitigation, adaptation and finance have been disaggregated. It is vital that we retain the progress we have made in this regard. We also welcome the progress the co-Chairs have made in producing a draft decision on action before 2020, especially in relation to mitigation ambition. Nevertheless we consider that the text is unnecessarily minimalist in its approach in relation to some key issues. The text does not give enough understanding of how the different elements of the agreement will work together to raise ambition and enable all parties to act, it is a question of coherence and effectiveness. In particular, the long term temperature goal is not clearly operationalized. The whole time-line guiding presentation and formalisation of successive commitments is extremely vague. In relation to mitigation dynamism, the global stocktake is poorly described - including how it relates to the updating of subsequent nationally determined mitigation commitments, how it relates to the long term goal of staying well below 2?C. The transparency & accountability section lacks essential elements; has only a placeholder for the role of expert review teams and only sets out a poorly defined work programme. We will be looking during the course of the week to strengthen both the Agreement text and decisions to address these and other concerns. We have heard and understand that many Parties do not find their essential negotiating positions in the non-paper. We acknowledge similar and different criticisms from other Parties in relation to the text. The non-paper is nevertheless the first time on the long road from Durban that we have text that is beginning to look like a Protocol, that has a clear agreeable structure, that is short and clear and that is capable of being negotiated. Only by all Parties engaging will we be able to ensure the text is complete. While we may not agree on substance on some issues, all Parties should have the opportunity to articulate their concerns based on the text with a view to clearly setting out options for Ministerial input where we cannot agree as negotiators. With only 5 negotiating days left before Paris, we must complete that task this week in Bonn. As we agreed yesterday in the consultations with the co- presidents, we should raise now the essential elements that we all must find in this draft to be able to make rapid progress in the coming days so that we can leave Bonn with a concise and well-structured text that avoids duplication and can be a good basis for reaching agreement in Paris. Finally we applaud all those Parties that have come forward with their INDCs. There are 150 INDCs from all regions, representing a coverage of almost 90% of global emissions, much more than in the past. These INDCs are much more than just numbers. The unprecedented level of engagement they represent will lead to real and significant transformation. They also represent an extraordinary effort on the level of domestic political engagement.

We meet here at the last ADP inter-sessional meeting before Paris determined to build a firm base for a successful outcome in Paris. As we have observed and emphasized many times before, developing countries are most seriously affected by the impacts of climate change and we face ever more frequent extreme weather events caused by climate change. Developing countries are responding to the challenge of climate change, as is demonstrated by the submission of ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in both mitigation and adaptation by so many developing countries, as well as by the results achieved by these countries on reducing significantly greenhouse gas emissions in the pre-2020 period. This shows the willingness to address climate change, despite not being legally obliged to do so and in many instances without the finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support by developed countries that has been agreed through this process. Co-Chairs I wish to confirm the Group\\x19s commitment to work in a disciplined and constructive manner so that we can successfully fulfil our mandate from Durban by the end of this year. In this regard, the Group wishes to acknowledge the work that you have done inter-sessionally in preparing the Non-Papers containing a draft agreement and draft decisions, including on pre-2020 ambition. The Group also welcomes the Co-Chairs\\x19 willingness to listen to the Group\\x19s views on the unacceptability of the Non-Papers as the basis for negotiations. We are pleased with the constructive and solution- oriented discussion we had with you bilaterally and with other Parties during your meeting with Heads of Delegations yesterday. As explained during those engagements, the Group of 77 and China is concerned that the text seems to attempt to rewrite, reinterpret and replace the Convention. It is extremely unbalanced and lopsided, to the extent that it jeopardizes the interests and positions of developing countries. We therefore concluded that the mandate given to the Co- Chairs was not fulfilled. It is therefore a reassuring sign that our negotiating partners have heard our concerns and that we could agree to a pragmatic solution that would ensure that we are able to move forward to the real textual negotiation with urgency. We wish to note that now, more than ever, we need clarity on the mode of work to avoid further delays due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of mandates. We emphasize once again that the purpose of the outcome in Paris is to enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, not to create a new regime or rewrite, replace, renegotiate or reinterpret the Convention. It shall be under the Convention and in full accordance with its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It shall address the core elements mandated by the Durban Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures in a comprehensive and balanced manner, both in the agreement and in the COP decisions. It is crucial that adaptation and mitigation receive the same priority. This must be supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building on a scale that matches the level of action required to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 and Article 4 of the Convention. We once again urge developed countries to provide enhanced finance, technology development and transfer and capacity- building support to developing countries for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions. In doing so, the principles and provisions of the Convention must be reflected in the elements of the agreement. On Workstream II, it is essential that the work on pre-2020 ambition be treated in a balanced manner with Workstream I. The Group emphasizes that addressing the pre-2020 ambition gap is vitally important to a successful outcome of the Paris COP and will lay a solid foundation for enhanced mitigation and adaptation action post-2020.

              "       ['163,2,11,11,20151019,sica,\"Mr. Co\\x10Chairs: I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Member States of the Central American Integration System (SICA) \\x13 Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and my country, El Salvador. We would like to associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co\\x10Chairs, the member states of the SICA are strongly committed to the establishment of a new agreement to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention. But we want to be emphatic that this must be negotiated and agreed upon under the Convention and in the faithful respect and compliance to their principles and provisions. These principles and provisions, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, must appear explicitly and effectively applied in all operational items of the new agreement and not be simply referred to as a mere formality in the preambular section. We shouldn\\x19t be forced to reiterate this time and again. The repeated calls for international cooperation appearing on the substantive articles of the implementation of the draft agreement proposed by you, Co-Chairs, especially articles in 3 to 8 of this draft, we can only understand and support under the purpose of reinforcing the implementation of the Convention in the context of its principles and provisions. Under any other interpretation such appeals in the draft agreement only would dilute the Convention, and eventually would lead to weaken the effective fulfillment of their ultimate goal. Misters Co-Chairs, there is nobody who does not recognize nowadays the crucial importance of the mitigation in this phase of increasing impacts and of disastrous losses and damages associated with the climate change. That\\'s why we insist that in the new agreement it must be recognized and be established explicitly the importance that developed countries assumes the lead which corresponds to them in terms of mitigation, as set out in the Convention and in the context of their historical responsibilities. Nevertheless, we cannot be wrong adopting a new agreement that prioritizes mitigation over the adaptation and the necessary means of implementation, without granting to them parity of political and legal importance. The commitments must not be exclusive for mitigation, while leaving open to the will of the international cooperation and solidarity the needs for adaptation, financing, development and technology transfer and capacity building. It cannot be expected to strengthen the climate action by only increasing the burdens on developing countries without the provision of the appropriate means of implementation for the efforts to be fair, equitable and in the required scale. Mr. Co-Chairs, adaptation is the top priority for developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, among which are the members of the SICA. In the new Agreement should be recognized that the greatest efforts of these countries, which in addition are very low emitters of GHG, should be directed to reduce vulnerability, to strengthen the adaptation and thus minimize the impacts and losses and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. In particular, the agriculture, food production and food security constitute inalienable adaptation priorities for our countries. There is already a huge and growing gap in adaptation and this must be properly recognized and managed in the new agreement. To do this, under the new agreement, Developed country parties shall communicate periodically their clear commitments and predictable funding for adaptation, at least of the same level as the intended for mitigation. The new agreement shall specify support to adaptation actions in the territories, in addition of support to the experiences and knowledge sharing processes. Although adaptation remains our priority, the SICA countries have launched plans, policies and development programmes which strongly drive the mitigation effort. These actions are consistent with our repeated call to all the parties for the new agreement to undertake as a goal to limit the increase in global average temperature to less than 1.5 degrees centigrade above the existing in the preindustrial era. The new agreement cannot ignore the scale of the current impacts of climate change nor the warnings on which, in this sense, multiple specializing investigations are converging. Also, losses and damages associated with the adverse effects of climate change are already exceeding the public finance capabilities of our countries, as well as in many others particularly vulnerable to climate change. The new agreement must set out the adequate and specific provisions to meet the needs associated with this problem, including migration and climate displaced peoples and communities, non economic losses and other effects associated with slow on set events. Mr. Co-chairs, we all, including the incoming presidency of the Conference of the Parties, agree that climate finance, additional, adequate and predictable is crucial to the adoption of an agreement truly ambitious and effective; and we welcome the fact that in article 5 of the draft agreement proposed by you, reaffirm the leadership that corresponds in this matter to developed \"'],\n",

In this last formal negotiating session before Paris, we need to keep an urgent focus on developing a text for a new agreement that is globally applicable, ambitious, legally binding and sets a credible and durable strategy for tackling climate change over coming decades. Co-Chairs, at the last ADP session the Parties asked you to assist us in this task. We thank you and welcome your efforts to produce a much more concise, focused and readable input for our work. This is, as we discussed, a step change that we needed. That said, we would be clear that as it stands, there are provisions in this non-paper that we have serious concerns with ? there are some provisions that cross redlines, and others that we think are not sufficient to deliver the ambitious and durable outcome we want. The text offers slim outcomes on progressively building global mitigation efforts, accountability and transparency ? components which will be critical to the quality of a Paris deal. We welcome the steps that have been taken to raise the profile of adaptation and climate resilience. We also recognise that financing and support will be an integral part of the Paris outcome. But further work will be needed to find workable landing zones and appropriate solutions with regard to issues such as finance and loss and damage. We also need to have a clear conception of the ongoing work program, associated timeframes and procedures that will be required to prepare for implementing the agreement. Umbrella Group countries are prepared to get straight into negotiations with all our colleagues to see where we can clarify and improve the contents of the agreement and decision. In doing so, we will need to stay focused on drawing out convergences and working on landing zones, as well as keeping in mind what is and isn??t politically and practically feasible. We believe this was the spirit in which the non-paper was prepared. We continue to welcome your guidance, Co-Chairs, in steering this process and reflecting the outcomes of the session. The non-paper also captures the broad support for a decision on enhancing mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period. There is still work to be done in workstream 2 on improving the technical examination process and how best to improve engagement with relevant Convention bodies and non-state actors. We look forward to considering how this work can be taken forward after the conclusion of the ADP. Finally, we are pleased to welcome the large number of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions that have been submitted. Every Umbrella Group country has submitted its INDC, and we congratulate all others that have done so. We continue to encourage those yet to submit to bring forward iNDCs as soon as possible. \"'],\n",

The Group wishes to thank you and our Co-Facilitators for your hard work during this week. We believe that, despite the initial difficulties, Parties managed to make progress during this session. Above all, the process and the outcome of this session are now fully Party-owned. In particular, we wish to thank you for the compilation paper containing a draft agreement and decisions on Workstream I and II, which were issued earlier this afternoon. The Group believes that this new text is balanced and reflective of the work done this week. As such this text can constitute a basis and a starting point for negotiations during the next session. It is important that the integrity of this text is maintained. In order to enhance this text, we suggest that it would be useful to request the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper, which should identify closely related paragraphs and duplications within sections, and possible areas for streamlining. This should only be an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing the content of the text. Regarding the draft decision that accompanies the agreement, we note that different approaches were followed in the Spin-Off Groups with respect to the different parts of the decision text. Unfortunately the Parties did not manage to have a complete reading of the decision text and a footnote could be included to note this situation and to ensure that the discussion of the text in question will be without prejudice to Parties?? positions. In light of the fact that the decisions still need considerable attention of the Parties, more time needs to be allocated for the discussions on the draft decisions for Workstream I and Workstream II.

I have the honour to submit this statement on behalf of the AILAC group of countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama?, Paraguay, Peru and our most recent member, whom we welcome in this COP21, Honduras. At the outset, AILAC associates its statement with the statement submitted by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The adoption of the Paris Agreement is not in the horizon anymore. It is imminent now that we are finally here at CoP 21 at last. Many efforts by all, have been made to get us here, and it is now time to move beyond mere assurances that our positions are reflected in the text, and provide for the compromise and bridging to happen with all of our partners to ensure that the ADP delivers to the CoP by next Saturday, that which it was mandated to deliver: a legally binding instrument, under the Convention, applicable to all, that addresses effectively and in a balanced manner mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency. The Paris Agreement must be durable and set the basis for enhancing ambition towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention, by means of implementing nationally determined commitments in a successive and progressive manner, with a view to arrive at commonly agreed goals on all elements: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The number of issues, concerns and the scale of the task, have put us in a situation where we have the challenge of condensing the complex text before us into a comprehensive, manageable, balanced output, ready for consideration of our Ministers by next Saturday. This calls for us to shift gears, and a monumental effort to focus our discussions into finding concrete solutions and common ground, and very few options per issue. Bearing this in mind, we support and very much hope that the modality of work set out by you in your scenario note, will allow us to achieve that purpose, and encourage all of our partners to keep focus on the more substantive aspects of our work without delay. Co\\x10chairs, Distinguished colleagues The outcome of the ADP, the Agreement we adopt here at CoP 21, is the ultimate opportunity we have to prove the worth of the multilateral system to be the most transparent, inclusive and balanced setting to address a challenge of global dimensions such as climate change, its causes and catastrophic effects, that affects unjustly, the world\\x19s most vulnerable population, an important part of which is found in AILAC countries. The system embedded in the Paris Agreement, must set out a clear direction of travel, with collectively agreed ambitious targets built around the 1.5?C long term temperature goal, which in turn must and shall be met by comprehensive ambitious and successive nationally determined commitments that deliver upon those targets, with developed country parties taking the lead. The Agreement must recognize and provide legal force to the actions that Parties have nationally determined and communicated, acknowledging both the capabilities and responsibilities of developed and developing countries respectively, as well as the need for action on behalf of all Parties to deliver on the necessary collective level of ambition. For AILAC, this collective commitment makes it imperative to reflect a long?term mitigation target aimed at net zero emissions by the end of the century and, consequently the effective implementation of mitigation commitments and provision of finance. A strengthened transparency system together with successive commitments on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation are necessary to ensure the progressive increase of ambition every five years. Parity must be achieved between adaptation and mitigation in the Agreement, supported by a real commitment on behalf of developed countries to provide resources on a global scale for mitigation and adaptation in a predictable, sustainable and appropriate manner.

Let me begin by thanking you for your hard work over the course of the year. We have accomplished much together and we look forward to completing our journey here with a fair and effective agreement that meets the interests of all parties. Co-Chairs, At nearly every meeting this year, since we first gathered in Geneva, these negotiations have opened in the aftermath of record and sometimes deadly extreme weather events around the world. Our membership has been struck by deadly typhoons in the Pacific, Hurricanes in the Caribbean, record tides and floods off the coast of Africa and in the Indian Ocean. Climate change is here and it is getting worse. What\\x19s more, the latest science confirms what we are seeing with our own eyes: The World Meteorological Organization reports that 2011-2015 has been the warmest five-year period on record and this year is on track to be the hottest ever. It also found that in 2014, sea level rise accelerated (3 millimeters) per year on average worldwide. This is around double the average annual rise of 1.6 mm in the 20th century. Co-Chairs, We must always be mindful that the principles and provisions of the Convention are the bedrock of our work and must be honored if we are to reach agreement on issues that have life and death consequences for our members. The Convention explicitly recognizes the particular needs and vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States and the new agreement must maintain this status in order to ensure our protection. Co-Chairs, For AOSIS, the Paris Agreement must be a balanced package that includes meaningful outcomes on all of the pillars of our mandate from Durban - mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building ? as well as loss and damage as a separate and distinct issue. In particular, we emphasise the following priorities: First, the Paris Agreement must establish medium and long-term emission reduction pathways that are capable of delivering a limitation of temperature increases consistent with this below 1.5-degree goal. The Agreement must demand ambitious performance from Parties through internationally legally binding, quantified mitigation commitments that increase global ambition over successive commitment cycles. Second, in terms of finance, tackling climate change and adapting to its impacts will require significantly scaled-up, new, additional and predictable financial resources, starting from a base of $100 billion USD per year by 2020, with provisions to enhance SIDS access especially to public, grant-based support for adaptation, given our unique challenges and the existential threat that climate change poses to us. Third, AOSIS welcomes the treatment of Loss and Damage as a standalone article in the draft agreement, particularly since it was not initially referenced. However, it must be articulated in an actionable form. Parties should recognise the need to address Loss and Damage associated with climate change and establish a process or system that is actually capable of doing so. In this regard, the approach proposed by the G77 and China accomplishes these objectives. AOSIS emphasises the role of the Convention in promoting the implementation of approaches to address Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, which should include, inter alia: Enhancing knowledge and understanding of comprehensive risk management approaches to address Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including slow onset impacts; Strengthening dialogue, coordination, coherence and synergies among relevant stakeholders; Enhancing action and support, including finance, technology and capacity- building, to address Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. We look forward to engaging with Parties on this critical issue in the same spirit of the progress that we have made, thus far. Finally, avoiding the worst impacts of climate change requires us to rapidly scale up and implement solutions in the near term. We believe Workstream 2 under the ADP, which focuses on pre-2020 ambition, has already produced a useful set of good practices and policy options for ramping up ambition. The Paris agreement should include a decision that strengthens the ongoing efforts to scale up voluntary multilateral and multi-?stakeholder cooperation under Workstream 2. In particular, the link between the technical and political levels should be improved, so AOSIS has called for the appointment of two high-level champions, supported by an expert team, to provide overall political guidance to the line of discussions. Workstream 2 is not an academic exercise. It must be about implementation. This meeting must be a turning point - our generation??s last best opportunity to meet the climate change challenge and accelerate the urgent transition to resilient, low-carbo\"'],\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement of the Group of 77 and China. Co-chairs, Given the limited amount of negotiation time, the BASIC countries commit to work with you and all other parties in a constructive spirit to advance the pace of negotiation in a fully party-driven manner to reach an equitable, ambitious, comprehensive and balanced agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that enhances the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. We reaffirm that the process and outcome of ADP should be guided by and be in full accordance with all principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. The Paris agreement shall address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate ? mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support. An ambitious outcome of the ADP should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner. We reiterate that commitments under the agreement must be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. We believe that ambition and effectiveness will be achieved by maintaining differentiation among developed and developing country Parties in each element of the agreement. This will enhance participation and efforts by all countries. We emphasize the importance of holding the increase in average global temperature below 2?C related to pre-industrial levels, through enhanced mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation for both. We affirm that the Paris agreement should provide for Parties to regularly prepare, communicate and implement their enhanced commitments and actions in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention. Contributions should be nationally determined and comprehensive, covering mitigation, adaptation and provision of support by developed countries to developing countries. We reiterate that developed countries must continue to take the lead in the post-2020 period, by committing and implementing ambitious, economy-wide, absolute quantified emission reduction targets, while developing countries will enhance their different types of mitigation efforts. We underscore the equal importance of adaptation and mitigation in the agreement. The Paris agreement should ensure the provision of adequate international support to developing countries, based on their needs and costs of adaptation. We emphasize that developed countries must provide financial resources, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries for their ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions under the Paris agreement, in order to progressively and substantially scale up their support in the post-2020 period, with USD 100 billion per year as a starting point. Public financial resources, distinct from ODA, should be the main source and funds from the private sectors can be complementary. We underscore the need for technology development and transfer to developing countries. The Paris agreement should provide for strengthening the existing technology mechanism, with a view to promoting cooperation on research and development, demonstration and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies and know-how, in particular addressing the issue of intellectual property rights by creating a window under the Green Climate Fund (GCF). We concur that a post-2020 enhanced transparency system of action and support should be built on the existing differentiated arrangements under the Convention, while providing flexibility to developing countries. We support the establishment of a global stocktaking of the overall implementation of the Paris agreement and progress towards achieving the objective of the Convention and the global temperature goal. The stocktaking should cover mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation in a comprehensive manner. With regard to the Workstream 2, we note with concern that pre-2020 ambition gaps exist not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation, finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. We highlight the need for increasing pre-2020 ambition by developed countries to build trust amongst Parties. We call for a strong, comprehensive and meaningful decision on pre-2020 ambition in Paris with a view to laying a solid foundation for post-2020 enhanced action. We urge those developed countries who have made pledges to the GCF to sign contribution agreements or arrangements as a matter of urgency.

Our Coalition welcomes the progress achieved during the most recent negotiating sessions and the mode of work you proposed for this first week here in Paris. Mr. Co-chairs, the 2015 agreement must respond to science and therefore include ambitious and scaled up commitments by all Parties in accordance with the principle of the Convention, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. In order to meet the 1.5?C scenario target, every Party must be encouraged to aggressively engage and scale up actions. The mitigation gap cannot be closed and the long term goal cannot be achieved without the contribution of REDD Plus. For the majority of developing countries and for around 2 billion people dependent on forests, this requires REDD+ to be clearly identified in the agreement as key element in the fight against global climate change. Moreover, the REDD+ mechanism must be established by the 2015 agreement so that the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ and all REDD+ related decisions are anchored permanently in the new climate treaty. The REDD+ mechanism will be based on existing methodologies and guidelines in line with the IPCC standards so as to ensure environmental integrity.

Since Durban, we have made a lot of progress towards the agreement all of us need to ensure the future on this planet is safeguarded. The political determination has never been as high. We know urgent action is imperative and recognize our responsibility to future generations. We are now in the last few days to work on the text we will present to ministers at the end of this week. We must use these days wisely, in a spirit of compromise, to be able to bring forward a text for the legally binding agreement applicable to all, and the decisions, that are concise, clear and coherent, with a limited number of political questions left open for ministers. We support the Co-Chair\\x19s scenario note as proposed, and suggest that their facilitators should have the flexibility to encourage informal work between groups of Parties to reach resolution on key issues. As our hosts stated on Saturday - with ownership comes responsibility! The Contact Group should be used to address cross-cutting issues and those issues not allocated to spin-offs and be able to concretely address issues throughout the week. The agreement must be ambitious, it must allow us to get on track for a world that can stay well below 2?C global warming and it must move us all towards climate resilience. It must also be fair, effective, and durable, putting our economies and societies onto a pathway that is compatible with achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention. We consider that the text needs work in particular in relation to the following key issues: The dynamic mechanism to raise ambition over time: This must include a stock take every five years that informs a process where all Parties would submit new INDCs or resubmit existing ones. The notion of progression over time is essential. We concur with others that mitigation and adaptation are equally important, but while elaborating them we have to recognise their specificities. The long term goal: the long term temperature goal of staying below 2?C global warming must be clearly operationalised to send the world a clear signal on the direction of travel all our economies and society are embarking on. A strong transparency and accountability system: to track progress of the steps forward of Parties towards achieving their targets. The INDCs need to be anchored firmly in the new legally binding Agreement. Transition to climate resilience: the agreement must help achieve development that is resilient to climate impacts. Support: the agreement needs to help mobilise support for those countries that need it, provided by those in a position to do so, to assist the implementation of action. As for many of our partners here, these are key pre-requisites for the European Union to achieve an agreement in Paris that is worth signing up to. We will be looking during the course of the next days to strengthen both the agreement text and decisions to address these and other concerns.

Throughout the ADP process we have reiterated that not only do developing countries face threats to their achievement of sustainable development, but also the very existence and survival of countries, societies and the ecosystems of our Mother Earth. It is for this reason that developing countries have had no choice but to act against climate change, even in the absence of adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed countries, as clearly demonstrated by the communication of INDCs by the majority of developing countries. Co-Chairs Because climate change is such a serious and urgent threat for developing countries, you can be assured that no group of countries is as committed as the G77 and China to a successful conclusion of our work under the ADP. I therefore wish to reiterate that the Group is fully committed to work in a disciplined and constructive manner. We wish to re-emphasise that the objective of the ADP is to enhance action and to promote the full and effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention. It is not within the ADP\\x19s mandate to replace, rewrite or reinterpret the Convention, its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. These principles and provisions of the Convention must be reflected in the elements of the agreement. The Paris outcome must address the core elements mandated by the Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures in a comprehensive and balanced manner, both in the agreement and in the COP decisions. Adaptation and mitigation must receive the same priority. This must be supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building on a scale that matches the level of action required to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 of the Convention. In this regard, we urge developed countries to provide enhanced finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions. Co-Chairs When we met in Bonn in October, much time was lost because we started with a text that was very unbalanced. Nevertheless, we believe that the text that we now have is a suitable basis to continue our negotiations. There is not much time left to conclude our work and we must therefore engage in substantive negotiations. We must be all very conscious of the fact that process will be crucially important for the success of the COP. In order to make progress, we suggest that cross-cutting and overarching issues, e.g. purpose, long-term goal, differentiation, progression, ambition and the cross cutting aspects of finance and the legal nature of different obligations across the text, be discussed in the Contact Group. As progress on these cross-cutting issues is essential to unlock the difficulties that are experienced in the Facilitation Groups dealing with mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, and final clauses, these discussions will accelerate the work in the Facilitation Groups. Postponing these important discussions in the Contact Group will not be helpful.\"'],\n",

This new agreement, applicable to all Parties, will be a watershed in our collective work under the UNFCCC. It is our duty to ensure the outcome is one of which we can be proud, that will cement and accelerate the changes that are already underway, as we transition to low-emissions, climate resilient societies. We are conscious of the limited time available, and wish to begin work straight away on substantive negotiations. To this end, we would propose that two spin-off groups be scheduled for Tuesday morning: one on finance and another on transparency of action and support. These issues are critical for the Paris agreement, and we think letting discussion begin on Tuesday morning will help ensure adequate time is devoted to reaching strong outcomes that can be supported by all Parties.

It must establish a strategy to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees including through a long-term global goal, mitigation contributions from all Parties, a periodic revisit, and robust rules for transparency and accountability. It must promote action to build resilience and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, and ensure that support continues to flow. We have before us as a starting point for our final negotiations the bare materials needed to reach this outcome. Our job is to mould the draft text into a clear, concise, and focussed text that captures landing zones and clearly articulates options on key political issues for our Ministers to consider next week. This will require all Parties to strive towards compromise, and work in a focused, organised manner. Umbrella Group countries are in Paris to negotiate. We are eager to start work straight away, and work constructively with all Parties on bridging options for the agreement and decision. We have confidence in the Co- Chairs to guide Parties?? work, recognising that modes of work may vary between groups. We must also allow space for Parties to consider decision text, which will be essential to advance arrangements in preparation for the agreement??s entry into force. And there is important work to be done in workstream 2 on improving the technical examination process and promoting effective engagement with relevant Convention bodies and non- state act\"'],\n",
              "       ['173,2,12,12,20151205,ailac,\"Distinguished Co Chairs. Fellow delegates. I have the honour to submit this statement on behalf of the AILAC group of countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama\\x01, Paraguay and Peru. At the outset, AILAC associates its statement with that submitted by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Four years ago in Durban, at CoP 17 we affirmed our collective will to prove that the multilateral setting under the UNFCCC was the forum that could provide a comprehensive and effective response to the global threat of climate change. The instrument to deliver this response: a new legally binding agreement, under the Convention, applicable to all, to set us on track, as a global community, towards the common target of holding the increase in the average temperature below 2?C or 1.5?C, and achieve a world without harmful emissions. Never before, have we been so close on delivering an ambitious outcome, which rises to the magnitude of this challenge. Never before have we moved so decisively in at attempt to bridge our interests, concerns and challenges into a single comprehensive course of action that delivers ambition on mitigation, adaptation and the associated means of implementation. Here in Paris, we have a unique opportunity to secure the future of generations to come. We must be able these coming 3 days, to move beyond national positions, to a solution cognisant of our collective interest of prosperity for people and planet, and beyond our national agendas or divergences. We cannot and we must not allow self-interest to deter us from doing what we know is right. CoP 21 is the place and the moment for a new chapter in the fight against climate change, one that delivers unequivocally on the mandate of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The Paris Agreement must be durable and set the basis for enhancing ambition towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention, by enabling the implementation of nationally determined commitments in a successive, progressive, and fully transparent manner, with a view to arrive at commonly agreed goals on all elements: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The Agreement must recognize and provide legal force to the actions that Parties themselves have nationally determined and communicated, acknowledging both the capabilities and responsibilities of developed and developing countries respectively, as well as the need for action to deliver on the necessary collective level of ambition. For AILAC, this collective calling makes it imperative to reflect a long-term mitigation goal that leads the world towards net zero emissions by the end of the century and, consequently the effective implementation of individual mitigation commitments and provision of finance to support developing countries to reach these. A strengthened transparency system, together with successively updated commitments on mitigation and means of implementation, are necessary to ensure the integrity of the agreement, promote trust between Parties and facilitate the progressive increase of ambition every five years. The Agreement must also provide parity between adaptation and mitigation, supported by a real commitment by developed countries to provide resources in a transparent and predictable manner, in particular through the definition of clear collective and regularly updated short term targets and the communication of individual quantified forward- looking information. An equitable and fair agreement must include Loss and Damage, a reality this is affecting countries and will continue permanently. Therefore, Loss and Damage must be adequately recognized and reflected in the agreement, including various institutional arrangements necessary to fully address the gravity of the issue. Let us also not forget that along with the agreeing an durable agreement that will facilitate enhanced ambition from post 2020 into future decades, Paris must also fortify and crystalize efforts by Parties and Non-Party stakeholders to increase ambitious action pre 2020, in order to close the dangerous emissions gap that continues to exist, threatening the continued development and sustainability and development of all countries. As we approach the end of this long journey from Durban to Paris, AILAC commends the efforts and recognizes the key role that many partners have had in bringing us to this important moment of our process. One of our own, Peru - as President of CoP 20 ? kept us moving forward on the road from Lima to Paris, always reminding us of the importance of unity and persistence towards our common objective. Five years ago, another regional partner, Mexico, as President of CoP 16 reminded us of the importance of trust, trust in each other and trust in the foundations laid 20 years ago under the Convention, as the enduring framework that can serve to catalyse global action, while recognizing our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. We now bestow our complete confidence in France, as the President of CoP 21, who has shown commitment to an inclusive road to Paris and who we trust will continue to preserve and pursue the important values of transparency, inclusiveness and party-driven nature of this process, which are critical to the success and endurance of the multilateral system. Because only if we all feel a part to this deal will we be able to tackle this problem once and for all. We have learned from the mistakes of the past, which will help us succeed here in Paris and beyond. Co- Chairs, Friends, AILAC is ready to continue moving forward in a constructive spirit, with bridge ? building proposals and paving the way for \"'],\n",

Mr. Co-chair, at the outset we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Our Coalition wishes to thank the Co-Chairs, the facilitators and the secretariat for their hard work. We deeply appreciate your tireless efforts and we believe the ADP has successfully completed its task. At the same time, we also would like to thank and support the effort of the French Presidency in the run-up to Paris and in particular in these days here at COP21. As usual, you can count on our group and our support. Mr. Co-chair, on Monday at the beginning of COP21, more than 60 heads of state and government clearly emphasized in their speeches the importance and the critical role of forest in the fight against climate change. Combating deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ and the respect for biodiversity were among the key terms utilized in more than 60 high-level speeches. Mr. co-chair, that is a strong political signal and we have been mandated to deliver. Therefore Mr. co-chair, a REDD+ Mechanism must be reflected in the agreement, based fully on those relevant decisions ALREADY agreed by the COP. Mr. Co-Chairs, our Coalition is prepared to work hard and constructively with you and all Parties in these final days with the view to achieve an historical outcome for future generations. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"'],\n",

The EIG would like to thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs, and all colleagues for the leadership and hard work. We think that we did make substantial progress over the last week. We were able to produce a text, which is much shorter and clearer than the text with which we began our work. The text, as it is, clearly contains the agreement, which we are going to adopt next week. It contains its elements, but it also reflects the important political decisions that we still have to resolve. It is a good basis for our further work. Let me highlight that in contrast to the COP 15 in Copenhagen, we do have a strong basis for our negotiations developed by all parties together. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear colleagues, the EIG is confident that we will be able to solve the open issues over the next days. The EIG is ready to work together with all of you over the next days in an open-ended, open-minded, solution oriented, ambitious and pragmatic, and cooperative manner to achieve what we all want and what we all need: a strong, durable and dynamic, legally binding agreement engaging all for the period post 2020. \"'],\n",

As such we look forward to our second week of negotiations in a spirit of compromise and cooperation with our negotiating partners and under the able guidance of the COP 21 Presidency.

The Group wishes to thank the Co-Chairs, the facilitators and the secretariat for their work to present to Parties the compilation text, as well as the document containing the facilitators\\x19 bridging proposals. We are very grateful for these tireless efforts throughout the duration of the ADP. The ADP has been engaged in sensitive and complex negotiations since the work was launched in Durban. The Group of 77 and China therefore welcome the progress that has been achieved. However, the output of the ADP could have taken us closer to the expected outcome in terms of the progress needed at this critical time. The Group had hoped that our work would have been further advanced at this point to put us in a position to forward a streamlined text to Ministers with clear options for political decision making. At this important point in the negotiaitons, the Group of 77 and China wish to reiterate its commitment to a fair and ambitious outcome of the ADP here in Paris on both pre-2020 ambition of actions and support, as well as the post-2020 agreement. We are ready to negotiate and work as fast as possible on the basis of the text containing the facilitators\\x19 bridging proposals. At this historic moment where all Parties will take a significant step forward in the fight against climate change, we must remain focused on what we agreed in Durban. The Group of 77 and China wish to re-emphasise its position that the Paris outcome must be under the Convention and in accordance with its principles and provisions and must not rewrite or reinterpret the Convention. The core elements mandated by the Durban Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures must be addressed in a comprehensive and balanced manner, both in the agreement and in the COP decisions. Adaptation and mitigation must receive the same priority. These must be supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building on a scale that matches the level of action required to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 of the Convention. We believe that we have come a long way and we have a text to take forward for further work by the COP. We realise however that much more work needs to be done in the next week to fulfil the mandate from Durban. As we prepare ourselves for the task that lies ahead next week, we should be reminded of the words of Nelson Mandela, who passed away two years ago on this day, that ??it always seems impossible until it??s done??.

              "       ['178,2,12,12,20151205,umbrella,\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to deliver this statement on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. We have truly come a long way since Durban. We enter the final week of our negotiations on a new global agreement with INDCs covering 185 countries on the table ? an unprecedented demonstration of our collective commitment to tackle climate change. Together, we have generated a text that holds within it the opportunity to conclude an ambitious and credible Paris Agreement that can establish a strategy to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees. This text reflects Parties options. We believe that all have engaged actively and constructively this week to express these options with as much clarity and conciseness as possible. Progress has not been as fast as we might have liked, but we can only take the next step, to develop real bridging proposals and landing zones, together. We thank you sincerely, co-chairs as well as your predecessors, and your co-facilitators for your leadership, that has guided us this far. We also express our support for the Presidency to guide negotiations next week in a way that continues to be transparent, party-driven and sees Ministers to engage effectively and provide the political guidance needed to unlock agreement. This process must allow us to deliver an ambitious agreement. Umbrella Group countries see this as one that sets: -  A long-term global goal to guide our collective efforts -  A commitment from all Parties to take on nationally determined mitigation contributions -  A periodic, harmonised process to revise contributions and build ambition -  Robust transparency and accountability rules that build trust and promote effective implementation -  And arrangements that promote adaptation and resilience, and that ensure finance, technology and capacity building support continues to flow to those Parties who need it. Let us be clear, we will not accept a minimalist outcome that leaves all the details to be decided after Paris. We need ambition and clarity, here and now. An ambitious outcome also means finding ways to reflect differentiation that are consistent with modern day realities, and incentivise all Parties to contribute to this global effort. We cannot get where we need to go, by doing what we have always done. As developed countries, we will continue to lead. But others with high capacity must join us. And all countries should progress in the same direction over time. We are also committed to an outcome on workstream 2 that incentivises greater emissions cuts to 2020 by creating a space to explore practical, real-world action, and bring together the people who make it happen. Umbrella Group countries stand ready to work with all Parties, and to offer our full support to the French Presidency to deliver an historic outcome here in Paris. Thank you. \"']],\n",

            "1,2,1,1,20130429,ailac,\"Thank you Co-Chairs, I have the honor of speaking on behalf of AILAC the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean). Let me begin by associating our Group with the intervention made by Fiji on behalf of the Group.  We are beginning a new era of the negotiations, in which we can now place our full attention on the urgent work of the ADP. It is important to highlight, however, that we are now well into the second year of our work, out of a period of four years that we have given ourselves to negotiate and finalize a new agreement. At this point in time, we are approximately six months from the halfway point to the finish line, and we are only just beginning concrete discussions. For this reason we are conscious of the urgency driving us to take a meaningful step forward in these negotiations. Under these negotiations, we find ourselves with unique opportunity to agree on a truly transformative agreement that will meet the objective of the Convention and the 2?degree goal in order to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system. At this juncture, we see the need to be flexible and creative, and to consider in our discussions all relevant issues as well as the interlinkages between these issues. We should look at the relationships between the different topics of negotiation and avoid a compartmentalized approach. We believe that the Convention is a living instrument, which should be interpreted in a dynamic way. Its principles are tools that should allow for the effective implementation of the Convention, in light of today s realities. More specifically, we believe that the appropriate scope of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities is as follows: common responsibilities reflected in the adoption of legally binding commitments by all parties; differentiated responsibilities in the sense that each Party should a make a fair contribution; and respective capabilities that should be taken into account in order to define the nature and amount of Parties contribution in relation to mitigation as well as means of implementation. We should remember that this principle should be a tool for action and not a refuge or excuse for inaction. The operationalization of these principles should help us achieve sufficient levels of effort to achieve our common objective of protecting the climate system and keeping the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. These joint actions are the only ones that can really lead us to reduce climate change impacts. When we all act, we are reducing the impacts and protecting the most vulnerable, and only then will we have achieved true climate justice. To ensure that all of the principles and their implementation are carried out in an ethical and transparent way, we should think responsibly and urgently about the rules that will allow us to achieve transparency and comparability in the efforts that we must all take forward. The Convention recognizes our right to sustainable development. The challenge before us is to achieve this without it leading to a dangerous increase in emissions levels. Examples in our own region demonstrate the efforts that we are all making to implement low emissions development strategies that will allow us to decouple our trajectories of economic growth from an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts such as these should be recognized and supported and the new agreement should include positive incentives for all parties develop in a sustainable, low carbon way. Just as we are acting on mitigation, we are also carrying the burden of adaptation with our own national resources. So far, we have not seen these efforts aided by concrete support mechanisms. Our countries are losing capital due to climate change, which is preventing us from continuing on a path of sustainable development. 2013 is also the year in which we will begin to undertake the review. In this process, we should find the elements based in science that inform the negotiations for decision making in 2015. This process should be the corner stone to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention, in accordance with the precautionary principle. Let me also add that we support your idea to create a contact group. We are flexible on whether to do so here in the April session or during the second part of this session in June. Distinguished Co?Chairs, we have 24 hours of discussion over the next 5 days of this session, which we hope will be very productive. We have had twenty years of negotiations, and we have two left to reach a new agreement. At this moment, each hour counts, because hour by hour the impacts of climate change increase around the world. And as our Philippine colleagues reminded us in Doha, tomorrow it could be anyone of our countries facing the devastating and debilitating effects of a climate change related natural disaster or extreme weather event. Thank you, Co?Chairs.\"\n"

Let me begin by associating our Group with the intervention made by Fiji on behalf of the Group.  We are beginning a new era of the negotiations', ' in which we can now place our full attention on the urgent work of the ADP. It is important to highlight', ' however', ' that we are now well into the second year of our work', ' out of a period of four years that we have given ourselves to negotiate and finalize a new agreement. At this point in time', ' we are approximately six months from the halfway point to the finish line', ' and we are only just beginning concrete discussions. For this reason we are conscious of the urgency driving us to take a meaningful step forward in these negotiations. Under these negotiations', ' we find ourselves with unique opportunity to agree on a truly transformative agreement that will meet the objective of the Convention and the 2?degree goal in order to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system. At this juncture', ' we see the need to be flexible and creative', ' and to consider in our discussions all relevant issues as well as the interlinkages between these issues. We should look at the relationships between the different topics of negotiation and avoid a compartmentalized approach. We believe that the Convention is a living instrument', ' which should be interpreted in a dynamic way. Its principles are tools that should allow for the effective implementation of the Convention', ' in light of today s realities. More specifically', ' we believe that the appropriate scope of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities is as follows: common responsibilities reflected in the adoption of legally binding commitments by all parties; differentiated responsibilities in the sense that each Party should a make a fair contribution; and respective capabilities that should be taken into account in order to define the nature and amount of Parties contribution in relation to mitigation as well as means of implementation. We should remember that this principle should be a tool for action and not a refuge or excuse for inaction. The operationalization of these principles should help us achieve sufficient levels of effort to achieve our common objective of protecting the climate system and keeping the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. These joint actions are the only ones that can really lead us to reduce climate change impacts. When we all act', ' we are reducing the impacts and protecting the most vulnerable', ' and only then will we have achieved true climate justice. To ensure that all of the principles and their implementation are carried out in an ethical and transparent way', ' we should think responsibly and urgently about the rules that will allow us to achieve transparency and comparability in the efforts that we must all take forward. The Convention recognizes our right to sustainable development. The challenge before us is to achieve this without it leading to a dangerous increase in emissions levels. Examples in our own region demonstrate the efforts that we are all making to implement low emissions development strategies that will allow us to decouple our trajectories of economic growth from an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts such as these should be recognized and supported and the new agreement should include positive incentives for all parties develop in a sustainable', ' low carbon way. Just as we are acting on mitigation', ' we are also carrying the burden of adaptation with our own national resources. So far', ' we have not seen these efforts aided by concrete support mechanisms. Our countries are losing capital due to climate change', ' which is preventing us from continuing on a path of sustainable development. 2013 is also the year in which we will begin to undertake the review. In this process', ' we should find the elements based in science that inform the negotiations for decision making in 2015. This process should be the corner stone to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention', ' in accordance with the precautionary principle. Let me also add that we support your idea to create a contact group. We are flexible on whether to do so here in the April session or during the second part of this session in June. Distinguished Co?Chairs', ' we have 24 hours of discussion over the next 5 days of this session', ' which we hope will be very productive. We have had twenty years of negotiations', ' and we have two left to reach a new agreement. At this moment', ' each hour counts', ' because hour by hour the impacts of climate change increase around the world. And as our Philippine colleagues reminded us in Doha', ' tomorrow it could be anyone of our countries facing the devastating and debilitating effects of a climate change related natural disaster or extreme weather event. Thank you', ' Co?Chairs.\"']\n"

              "array(['\"Thank you Co-Chairs, I have the honor of speaking on behalf of AILAC the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean). Let me begin by associating our Group with the intervention made by Fiji on behalf of the Group.  We are beginning a new era of the negotiations, in which we can now place our full attention on the urgent work of the ADP. It is important to highlight, however, that we are now well into the second year of our work, out of a period of four years that we have given ourselves to negotiate and finalize a new agreement. At this point in time, we are approximately six months from the halfway point to the finish line, and we are only just beginning concrete discussions. For this reason we are conscious of the urgency driving us to take a meaningful step forward in these negotiations. Under these negotiations, we find ourselves with unique opportunity to agree on a truly transformative agreement that will meet the objective of the Convention and the 2?degree goal in order to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system. At this juncture, we see the need to be flexible and creative, and to consider in our discussions all relevant issues as well as the interlinkages between these issues. We should look at the relationships between the different topics of negotiation and avoid a compartmentalized approach. We believe that the Convention is a living instrument, which should be interpreted in a dynamic way. Its principles are tools that should allow for the effective implementation of the Convention, in light of today s realities. More specifically, we believe that the appropriate scope of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities is as follows: common responsibilities reflected in the adoption of legally binding commitments by all parties; differentiated responsibilities in the sense that each Party should a make a fair contribution; and respective capabilities that should be taken into account in order to define the nature and amount of Parties contribution in relation to mitigation as well as means of implementation. We should remember that this principle should be a tool for action and not a refuge or excuse for inaction. The operationalization of these principles should help us achieve sufficient levels of effort to achieve our common objective of protecting the climate system and keeping the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. These joint actions are the only ones that can really lead us to reduce climate change impacts. When we all act, we are reducing the impacts and protecting the most vulnerable, and only then will we have achieved true climate justice. To ensure that all of the principles and their implementation are carried out in an ethical and transparent way, we should think responsibly and urgently about the rules that will allow us to achieve transparency and comparability in the efforts that we must all take forward. The Convention recognizes our right to sustainable development. The challenge before us is to achieve this without it leading to a dangerous increase in emissions levels. Examples in our own region demonstrate the efforts that we are all making to implement low emissions development strategies that will allow us to decouple our trajectories of economic growth from an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts such as these should be recognized and supported and the new agreement should include positive incentives for all parties develop in a sustainable, low carbon way. Just as we are acting on mitigation, we are also carrying the burden of adaptation with our own national resources. So far, we have not seen these efforts aided by concrete support mechanisms. Our countries are losing capital due to climate change, which is preventing us from continuing on a path of sustainable development. 2013 is also the year in which we will begin to undertake the review. In this process, we should find the elements based in science that inform the negotiations for decision making in 2015. This process should be the corner stone to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention, in accordance with the precautionary principle. Let me also add that we support your idea to create a contact group. We are flexible on whether to do so here in the April session or during the second part of this session in June. Distinguished Co?Chairs, we have 24 hours of discussion over the next 5 days of this session, which we hope will be very productive. We have had twenty years of negotiations, and we have two left to reach a new agreement. At this moment, each hour counts, because hour by hour the impacts of climate change increase around the world. And as our Philippine colleagues reminded us in Doha, tomorrow it could be anyone of our countries facing the devastating and debilitating effects of a climate change related natural disaster or extreme weather event. Thank you, Co?Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of 44 countries that are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS associates itself. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me also thank you for your leadership during this phase of the negotiations. You have set the stage for us to make essential progress this week and beyond. I assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work expeditiously to close the emissions gap and fulfill other commitments laid out in the Durban agreement. The time we have to act, it cannot be said enough, is rapidly slipping away for the members of the group of countries that I represent. Scientists have warned that unless urgent and dramatic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, I repeat, well before 2020, the opportunity to avoid catastrophic global warming in excess of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - to say nothing of the below 1.5 degree threshold supported by over 100 countries in this room - could be irrevocably lost. The perilous circumstances we face were underscored last week when researchers at the Mauna Loa laboratory confirmed that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are on track to, this month, exceed 400 parts per million for sustained lengths of time throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere. This ominous milestone is particularly unsettling for the citizens of small island and low-lying coastal states who have already experienced life-altering changes due to warming of less than one-degree Celsius, including stronger and more deadly tropical cyclones, prolonged droughts, the loss of mangrove habitat, and, perhaps most alarmingly, an acceleration in sea level rise. What\\'s more, we know that coral reefs, which support many of our economies, and buffer us climate-related extreme weather events, are likely to stop growing if the 450-ppm mark is passed and start dissolving at concentrations beyond 550 ppm as ocean acidification intensifies. In light of these harsh realities, we must achieve an ADP agreement that ultimately brings CO2 concentrations back below these levels to limit warming below 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. Co-Chairs, It is in this context that AOSIS wants to emphasize- as we have done in our formal ADP submissions- that our work this week and in June must focus intensely on delivering concrete outcomes for the climate that sustains us all. We have no other formal process to address our concerns except this multilateral process and therefore failure for us is a direct threat to our very existence. With a view to giving this focus to our work, we have all agreed to organize our discussions into two separate workstreams - Workstrearm 2 is tasked with identifying ways to raise mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 timeframe and Workstrearm 1 with elaborating the details of a protocol to be adopted by 2015 at the latest. Work in both Workstrearms must be driven by a sense of urgency, bearing in mind that our failure to act decisively now will require a reactive and vastly more expensive response later. Moreover, a failure to close the pre-2020 initigation ambition gap will have profound implications for the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 protocol. But despite these linkages, the discussions for both workstreams must remain separate. In this context, we reiterate our call for two distinct contact groups to ensure that the subject matter for the two workstreatns is kept separate. In terms of Workstream 2, we need to use our two sessions in Bonn to focus closely on specific and scalable mitigation actions and policies that can be deployed immediately, including those outlined in the UNEP gap report, and also look at strategies for overcoming implementation barriers, including the scaled up delivery of financial resources, technology and capacity building. We welcome the roundtables proposed by the Co-Chairs, but will want to bring more focus to our work as the year proceeds. At the same time, we must expand the conversation beyond purely climate negotiators and work to engage those with on-the-ground expertise in the development and implementation of successful mitigation actions in this process-civil society, scientists, the private sector and experts from the relevant ministries within our governments. Of course, the decision to raise ambition ultimately requires engagement at the highest level, so we are calling for a ministerial meeting on raising mitigation ambition at COP19 in Warsaw to help build the political momentum necessary for the adoption of more ambitious mitigation targets by developed countries and NAMAs by developing countries. We welcomed the announcement made by the UN Secretary-General in Doha that he will convene a leaders summit in 2014, which will serve as an important decision point for countries to raise their ambition. Co-Chairs, We must also make progress in Workstream 1 on the core elements of the new legally binding agreement to be adopted in 2015. We know all too well that turning policy into action can be a painfully slow process, so the decisions we make today must be guided by the science, and sufficiently ambitious to protect the interests of future generations, as well as our own. Our work moving forward should continue to build on the foundations of the Convention, including its fundamental principles and provisions. In the view of AOSIS, the outcome of the process launched under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action should be a Protocol under the Convention applicable to all Parties, to be adopted no later than 2015, which strengthens the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, based on science and designed to ensure the survival of the communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Being applicable to all, it wil require universal participation and contributions from every Party. As we see the alarming impacts of our past of inaction on climate change unfold before our eyes, and the very real economic, social and physical costs of this inaction grow larger, perversely, the solutions to the climate crisis are more accessible and less costly than ever before. Nevertheless there is an ongoing need for financial support and technology transfer and capacity building to developing countries. This is about political will, and our mandate from Durban makes it clear that this process shall raise ambition. We urge all Parties to work with an increased sense of urgency this week and above all focus on doing our part to achieve all ambitious, comprehensive and meaningful outcome. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs I have the honor to take the floor on behalf of the Arab Group comprising the 22 member states of the League of Arab States. Let me first start by associating the Arab Group. The Arab group congratulates you on the effective and cordial manner in which you have led our work since last April. We look forward to a productive and constructive dialogue and exchange of views under your leadership this week and in the resumed June session. The Arab Group considers that the international climate change regime is founded on the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and of the KP. Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention represent in our view the basis for international cooperation in the fight against climate change, namely through the principle of CBDR , equity, and the responsibility for historical emissions, and the absolute priority for developing countries to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication in line with their national strategies and priorities. These fundamentals are not to be reinterpreted or renegotiated but instead our work should be grounded on them and they should be reemphasized in any 2015 outcome we collectively reach. The Arab Group stresses that our objective should be the full and sustained implementation of the Convention through the full implementation of the outcomes emanating from the Bali processes and the Durban and Doha decisions. Our working the ADP shall be informed of the progress in implementation of the commitments made in Durban and Doha relative to the second commitment period of the KP and the implementation and delivery of commitments in the areas of adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. Merely creating new institutions is not enough , but should be translated into concrete time-bound deliverables to assist developing countries requirements for adaptation and mitigation. In this regard, we call for our deliberations in the ADP to be constantly informed by the progress reached in the various subsidiary bodies. In fact, in our view, any 2015 outcome should not be mitigation-centered but should incorporate and integrate all these aspects for which much efforts have been exerted since 2005. We call for balanced progress in our work in the elaboration of the content of all these building blocks. Our goal should be to bridge the ambition gaps in all these matters with the same level of seriousness and resolve if we are to deliver by 2015 an outcome that is effective and that all could feel ownership of. The Arab Group will no doubt assume its fair share of the global efforts to combat climate change. Much is already taking place in individual Arab countries to delink their economic development strategies from the growth of their emissions and to implement new and renewable energy strategies. However, Arab countries will not agree with any attempt to move away or side step the founding principles of international cooperation in the field of climate change, or any attempt by some to renege on their legal obligation to take the lead in global efforts by shifting to developing countries the burden to fill the gap between the level of required emission reductions required by science and their low mitigation commitments. We believe that in order to foster trust and give a push to the ADP negotiations, Annex 1 countries members of the KP are called upon to urgently complete their ratification of the second commitment period, and revise their mitigation ambition upward in 2014. Non- KP Annex 1 countries or Annex 1 countries that chose not to be part of the second commitment period of the KP are called upon to exert comparable emission reduction efforts. There should also be a swift progress in the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund as well as urgently addressing the missing elements pertaining to long term finance in the Doha outcome. Furthermore, we call on all sides to desist from unilateral trade measures in the name of climate change, and to effectively address the socio-economic impact of response measures on developing countries and assist those countries in need to diversify their economies in order to face the repercussions of climate change. In closing, the Arab Group reiterates its commitment to work with all parties towards the success of our collective journey to 2015 so that its outcome responds to the aspirations of the international community, and to realize a shift in the mindset in these international negotiations away from finger pointing to a principled approach grounded on equity and fairness. I thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. By 2015 we must adopt a legally binding instrument from 2020 that will be an effective response to the urgent challenge of climate change; 2015 is around the corner - we need a clear vision of milestones over the next three years: this year we must achieve and capture core elements of the 2015 Agreement, including in relation to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, capacity building and common rules; The EIG is ready to work with you and all the Parties in a focused manner to this aim; The EIG calls for a legally binding instrument with all Parties taking appropriate mitigation commitments of same legal form, which includes targets or actions, under the same rules and at different depths in terms of type of commitment, timing, and level of effort according to CBDR/RC and equity; The instrument must also adequately address Adaptation, Support and transparency. Dynamic differentiation between the Parties according to CBRD/RC and equity is key for a fair and enduring instrument. A common understanding on a fair differentiation must be developed in order to address the climate challenge and respond to findings of latest scientific knowledge; Mr. Co-Chairs, Mitigation is not a break to development but an opportunity for wellbeing and development; The 2015 Agreement must be a win-win instrument for all: else we will not succeed; We have another very urgent matter at hand: pre-2020 ambition; We have to close the emissions gap in view of achieving the target to keep global warming below 2 degrees with respect to historic levels. Therefore, there is a need to increased action within and outside the Convention. The EIG countries are ready to cooperate with the other Parties to discuss these approaches in view to make progress on workstream 2. Mr. Co-chairs, The EIG would also like to underline the importance of the other ongoing processes relevant for success under workstreams 1 and 2 of the ADP. This includes: the clarification of the 2020-pledges, supporting the needs for implementation and progress in the understanding and predictability of mobilisation of climate finance. Especially, the EIG countries emphasize the urgency of the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund.\"',\n",
              "       '\"I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, its 27 Member States and Croatia. In Durban, we reaffirmed our shared goal of keeping the global temperature increase below 2?C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. We know that we face potentially devastating impacts if we fail to achieve this goal. We also know that, collectively, Parties are not yet on an emissions pathway consistent with that goal. Global GHG emissions continue to increase. As the Executive Secretary has indicated, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are exceeding levels ever experienced in human history and are predicted to exceed 400ppm by 2014. We have also had recent reports on the potential consequences of failure to stay within the temperature goal. There is an urgent need for progress. In Doha, the EU and others signed up to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which we are already implementing. All Parties contributed to bringing the LCA to a successful conclusion. Demonstrating progress on the implementation of Cancun pledges by those outside the KP second commitment period may be more difficult, but is just as important to the climate. In this context, it was very welcome and useful that the SB Chairs provided an update on their work; we see the value in further such updates as our work progresses. This week needs to set a positive basis for the year ahead as we move towards Warsaw. The EU is ready to work with all Parties to move quickly into focused discussions on the issues at hand. Under the ADP, we agreed to work towards a single, fair and comprehensive, legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties. We acknowledged the urgent need to close the pre-2020 mitigation gap to keep the below 2?C goal within reach. Mr. co-Chairs, we fully support the goal of this session, set out in your informal note, to build on the broad, conceptual and scoping discussions we had in 2012, and engage in more specific and detailed work on the core elements of the 2015 agreement and a practical and results-orientated approach to increasing pre-2020 ambition. Under workstream one, we welcome the workshop on the scope, structure and design of the 2015 agreement and subsequent roundtables. In particular, we look forward to identifying with other Parties how they see a spectrum of mitigation commitments emerging in such a way that is fair and reflects evolving economic realities and development opportunities for all Parties while ensuring an adequate global response to the climate change challenge, taking into account the need to keep the global temperature increase below 2?C goal. Under workstream 2, we need to work on identifying concrete actions that will help us close the gap between what science tells us is required and the pledges put forward by Parties to date. We know that there are a number of ways to achieve this, including through more and enhanced pledges as well as through international cooperative initiatives. In response to the urgency expressed by all Parties at Durban and reaffirmed at Doha, workstream 2 must, this year, produce tangible deliverables that result in actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Raising ambition through existing and new pledges is essential but we must also take concrete steps on additional actions that offer significant potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale.

              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs I have the honor to deliver this statement. This being the first meeting of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, it is my welcome duty to express here the appreciation of the Group on the sterling leadership with which you Co- Chairs conducted our affairs last year. The Group appreciated the skillful manner in which you steered our discussions. We have become accustomed to your Leaderships. The Group looks forward once again to working with you this year; I assure you that you can again count. Mr. Co- Chairs In Doha we decided that the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action ADP) will consider elements for a draft negotiating text no later than at its session to be held in conjunction with the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties, due to be held from Wednesday, 3 December to Sunday, 14 December 2014, with a view to making available a negotiating text before May 2015. Also in Doha, we decided to identify and to explore in 2013 options for a range of actions that can close the pre-2020 ambition gap with a view to identifying further activities for its plan of work in 2014 ensuring the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention. The Group acknowledges with appreciation the work and the thinking that are reflected in the Informal Note which you have kindly circulated prior to this meeting. We have taken due note of your suggested goals for the session, we appreciate the sharing of your ideas and proposals on how the work of the ADP2 is to be organised and we are currently reflecting on the sets of questions which you ve posed for our discussion. May I convey that the Group concurs that this April Session should be utilised to build on the broad, conceptual and scoping discussions carried out last year and to that end will support efforts by parties to engage in more specific and detailed work on the core elements of the 2015 agreement and a practical and result- orientated approach to increasing pre- 2020 ambition. Mr Co- Chairs The Group takes note of the proposal by the two Co-Chairs to establish the contact group at this session of the ADP. The Group supports in principle the establishment of the contact group under the two Co-Chairs to facilitate work and focus. The contact group would convene when necessary with the agreement of the parties. Mr Co-Chairs Let me now make some substantive remarks on the ADP. The following are very clear in our mind: The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles. and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of  implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. In addition, the Group of 77 and China applauds the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Our efforts should now be focused on bringing those amendments into effect at the earliest opportunity. We therefore urge all Parties to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible. The Group is also of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. Indeed, it should strengthen the multilateral rule-based regime in order for the Convention to achieve its ultimate objective. Finally, we consider that any action to increase pre- 2020 ambition should be guided by the objectives and principles of the Convention. Given the urgency of our situation, the Group wishes to highlight the need to increase and expedite efforts to close the ambition gap. In addressing this gap, focus must not only be limited to mitigation but also address gaps relating to finance, technology and support for capacity building. Failure to address these gaps will not only have impact in the short term but will also have profound impact on the scale of commitment that would be required under the 2015 agreement, which should be guided by the principles and provisions of the Convention. In this connection, the Group reiterates its call for developed countries to take leadership and do more in the provision of the means of implementation. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, Madam Executive Secretary and colleagues. Nepal has the honor to make this statement on behalf of the LDCs. I associate myself with the statement. Co-Chairs, first of all, we express our appreciation to the Government of Germany for hosting this meeting. We would also like to express our gratitude to all the Parties that have provided voluntary contributions to make this meeting possible and to the Secretariat for the excellent arrangements. Co-Chairs, for the proposed workshops and roundtable discussions, we urge you to give us sufficient time for discussions. In terms of contact groups, our preference is to have two contact groups for the two workstreams. We hope this will be the case in the future. We are also delighted that you have allocated a special session for observers. Co-Chairs, under workstream I, it is time to start defining the structure and content of a robust science-based, equitable and inclusive regime to tackle climate change in an effective and efficient manner. The thematic areas need to be addressed in a way to keep the ADP manageable and provide it with the opportunity to deliver in a timely manner. The common but differentiated responsibilities; countries\\x19 different and evolving capabilities; equity; historical, current and future trend of emissions; all need to be addressed in a meaningful and constructive manner, and not hold back the discussions. Co-Chairs, Parties should initiate discussions around the many complex and crucial issues needed to operationalize the principles and provisions of the Convention and define what kind of approaches and types of commitments could be considered while designing the 2015 regime. How do we effectively articulate the various elements of the future regime: mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity building, technology, transparency of action and support in a balanced manner? Co-Chairs, we value the opportunity provided by workstream II to rapidly identify and implement enhanced mitigation actions with a view to stopping, reversing and closing the gap by 2020, to avoid increased impacts and to minimize climate induced loss and damage. Issues regarding the means to support rapid implementation of urgent but win-win mitigation options are a central component of workstream II. Co-Chairs, adaptation is an extremely important issue especially for the LDCs as well as for other vulnerable countries. We believe action on adaptation should be further enhanced in the ADP. Nevertheless, adaptation will have its limits; therefore, in the long-term mitigation is the best form of adaptation. Otherwise, LDCs will be confronted with a situation where adaptation requirements will far exceed capacities even if all possible international support would be provided. Co-Chairs, you will recall that in Durban, the LDC group supported the agreement on workstream II with the specific mandate to close the emissions gap between the current level of ambition and what science tells us we need to achieve to be able to limit global warming below 1.5??C. We would like to see substantial progress on pre-2020 mitigation ambition, as the success or the failure of workstream II would affect the results negotiated under workstream I on the post-2020 agreement. As the world??s most vulnerable, we have the moral right to claim that all the countries must take immediate and urgent climate action. We know that political will can close most of the gaps that would lead us to an unthinkable future. Though the science-driven climate project achieved a great deal, we now know that science alone cannot take us further. We need more action on the ground, driven by scientifically informed political will. The LDCs will continue to engage productively and proactively and will continue to play a leadership role in the interest of the nearly one billion most vulnerable people that we represent in this process. We are the first group to experiment and im\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. Co-Chairs, We come to this meeting ready to get to work - under your able leadership. We are all familiar with what the ADP has been asked to deliver. Through a new global agreement, and work on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition, we have been tasked with delivering a more effective response to climate change. A response built on common action and ambitious global co-operation, and which revitalises the UNFCCC for the challenges of a new century. We want a global regime that helps foster national action - because it is national action that will ultimately reduce emissions, prepare countries for climate impacts, and build climate considerations into long-term economic and development planning. Throughout last year and at Doha we had useful, conceptual discussions and made some progress in identifying areas of commonality and convergence under both workstreams. But if we are to deliver our work on time in 2015, we need to keep bringing greater focus and depth to our discussions. Co-Chairs, The world is looking to us all to deliver a climate effective new agreement, applicable to all Parties, by 2015. To do so we now need to engage on the hard questions that lie at the heart of the agreement. And we need to better understand each other - the factors that will pull countries toward ambitious participation in the new agreement, as well as the factors that may hinder participation. We look forward to further discussions, at this session, on how we can design the new agreement in a way that: captures the participation of all Parties, with a spectrum of contributions that sees all countries act in a way that reflects their national circumstances; allows flexibility for countries differing contexts and capacities, but also ensures the transparency and environmental integrity of action\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs. We wish to express our appreciation. We also thank those countries that have made contributions, which have enabled us to participate at these SBs sessions. I take this opportunity to thank you for how you have guided the work of the ADP so far, and further thank you Co-Chairs for convening part 2 of the 2nd session of the ADP. The Africa Group pledges its support to you as we enter a more focused mode of work, building on the plan of work we agreed on in Doha and advancing the discussions from the first part of the second session we had in April/May. Co-Chairs, the Africa Group generally supports the proposals made in your information note of the 24th of May 2013, particularly in regards to the organization of work where this June session is being resumed, having been adjourned in May. We view this June session as important in further deepening our focused work though workshops and roundtables. Further, in the interests of advancing the discussion and making progress, we view the June session as building blocks towards taking some decisions at COP19 In November. From the outset, Co-Chairs, let me reiterate that in respect of the 2015 agreement, it is the Group s view that all the principles and provisions of the Convention apply. As such, the ADP is not a renegotiation of the Convention and its Annexes. Further, the Africa Group views the work of the ADP as a realization of a balanced package from Durban in respect of and agreement to negotiate an agreement that will guide the implementation of the Convention beyond 2020. Co-Chairs, given Africa s situation, sustainable development and poverty eradication remain the priorities for the continent; therefore the agreement should reinforce a fair, multilateral rules based regime that brings to effect the right to equitable access to sustainable development. In this respect, we would like to emphasise that adaptation is a key issue for the African continent. As such, the Group welcomes the workshop on enhancing adaptation through the 2015 agreement and calls for discussions to consider a global adaptation goal that is linked to a global temperature goal. Co-Chairs, in respect to Workstream II, we welcome the discussion on enhanced actions but urge that these be expanded to incorporate issues of compliance with scientifically-determined targets and the MRV of the means of implementation. In this respect, Co-Chairs, the Africa Group calls for leadership from developed countries in raising ambitions as a basis of building trust. In relation to linkages with other bodies of the Convention, We note the briefing sessions from other Convention related bodies and further call for discussion on how the established bodies of the Convention will relate to the work of the ADP. Co-Chairs, it is the Africa Group s position that to facilitate fairness in the contributions by various Parties towards the achievement of the global goals, as well as towards operationalisation of equity rather than its definition, a non-binding, principle-based Equity Reference Framework that reflects relative fair efforts by Parties in responding to mitigation and adaption is necessary. The relative efforts should consider the combined mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology responsibility of a Party, against which nationally derived commitments can be assessed. Co-Chairs, we recognize the timelines between now and the expected draft text next year and call for a September session. The September session should deepen the discussion on the ADP and produce a report that the new Co-Chairs can use for continuity. The Africa Group calls for progress towards establishing a contact group, and in particular to clarify how many contact groups should be established. The September meeting could give us the opportunity to discuss this and avoid further delays on contact groups.  Co-Chairs, Africa stands ready to work constructively during these two weeks and the next ones in November and to engage meaningfully in identifying means and ways respecting both national circumstances, voluntary essence of mitigations actions for developing countries, in the context of relevant principles and provisions of the Convention. Co-Chairs, I thank You. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Chair, good morning colleagues. Being this the first time we take the floor, we\\'d like to thank you and congratulate your efforts so far, we remain in your hands and will continue to support your endeavors; AILACs spirit in these negotiations is to build bridges within the variety of realities, capacities and responsibilities among different groups and countries. We have the willingness to act and remain at your disposal for ideas, available to enhance our ambition and to lead with example; In this spirit, we believe the purpose of the ADP should be focused in enhancing action for achieving the 1.5C global goal, that is to say to fulfill the ultimate objective of the Convention; We agree that our work is not in a vacuum, but is oriented by all the work carried on under the Convention, and directed to its ultimate goal; We all have something to contribute to this end. AILAC is and will continue its efforts to contribute. However, the aggregate efforts have proven insufficient, with the impacts of inactions affecting all parties broadly; in this context, the work under both ADP workstreams call for urgency; The design of the agreement should appropriately combine elements of a bottom-up approach, that should allow for each party to define it s own contribution, taking into account its national circumstances and capacity, with elements from a top-down structure to enable comparability of efforts and ensure that the efforts undertaken are leading us to achieve the 1.5C global goal. Whatever the design of the commitment structure, it must have at least the following characteristics. It should be: Differentiated, according to our national circumstances; Time-bound; Quantified in terms of reduced or avoided GHG emissions; Subject to comparability based on transparency; and finally; Open to external scrutiny Co-chairs, we are concerned. The discussion seems to have a tendency to evolve towards an over-flexibilization of the regime. At this early stage we should strategically be aiming at the highest possible ambition. In this context, we understand flexibility is necessary in  multilateralism. This should not prevent some basic elements to be incorporated in the 2015 agreement: The existence a common rules-based system; The scientific foundation of our work that has to be at the core of our agreements to secure the environmental integrity of the results; The transparency of the regime in terms the efforts undertaken and the results achieved; Co-Chairs, the discussions on differentiation is fundamental and helpful in order achieve universal participation in the new agreement, as well as effective and transparent comparability of effort that requires accurate data analyses; AILAC believes there must be a robust review process in the new agreement, simultaneous for all parties, while differentiated according to the nature of the party s commitment. It should allow for ex ante and ex post review, It is our view that means of Implementation should be enshrined in the 2015 agreement. In practice, this implies that matters related to finance, technology transfer and capacity building are included in the agreement. In particular, we see that the agreement would include quantified commitments on the provision of finance for climate change action. We also consider that it is fundamental that these commitments are part of the ex-ante and ex-post review processes that are emerging as a means to ratchet up mitigation ambition in the 2015 agreement. Adaptation must also be part of the core of the 2015 agreement, in a balanced manner. We need to build upon the current institutions under the Convention, but also go beyond the status-quo by giving adaptation an equally important space in the agreement as mitigation. The new agreement should also include commitments in terms off funding for adaptation. Loss and damage will need to be fully addressed in the new 2015 agreement. Finally, our success in achieving the Conventions ultimate objective will require a robust compliance mechanism for the commitments undertaken by all parties. Dear co-chairs, we believe work under WS2, according to the paragraphs 7 and 8 of decision 1cp17, should focus in closing the mitigation gap pre-2020, in order to achieve our common global goal of limiting temperature rise below 2 to 1.5C, as required by science. We would like to recall, the fact that the main reason why we succeeded in getting an agreement on the ADP in Durban was the inclusion of this workstream, following the lead of our colleagues from AOSIS. In this sense, we welcome the pragmatic approach taken so far in the development of our work program, focusing first and foremost in the sectors that offer the higher and most cost effective, scalable mitigation potential. The energy sector is a good starting point, despite the fact that we are available to consider undertaking similar approaches to other key sectors, namely: a broader approach to energy including generation, transmission, distribution and consumption), transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors. The non-paper presented by our distinguished colleagues from AOSIS is a valuable input to this end, which we very much welcome. We strongly believe that work under this workstream depends on a mutual reinforcement between momentum achieved at the national level, where we as negotiators and sectorial experts play a paramount role, and the political leverage that stems from our efforts in this forum. If only the lowest ambition pledges are implemented, emissions could be lowered to 53Gt C02eq by 2020, leaving us with a Gap of 9Gt Co2eq needed to have a likely chance of limiting global warming to 22c. Now, even in a scenario where the highest ambition of all country commitments under the Cancun Agreements are implemented and supported, the gap will remain at around 7 Gton Co2eq. This emphasizes the urgency of delivering concrete results under WS2, and the need for us all to enhance actions to mitigate before 2020. AILAC is extremely concerned at a time when we have surpassed the threshold of 400 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. Therefore, we believe we must identify concrete actions that will allow al l Parties to enhance contributions towards bridging the gap.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. President, Nicaragua has the honor to make this statement on behalf of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America. Mr President, we would like to reiterate ALBA commitment to support their work and assist in identifying commonalities so that we can move forward with the implementation of the Convention. Additionally, we would like to express on this occasion our perspectives on the work that ADP has done and should continue to do doing to fulfill its mandate.  Dear colleagues, We must be honest and express ALBA concern for the progress and focus that the work of the ADP is developing. Us I would like to remind everyone of what was agreed in decision 1 of 17 Conference of the Parties, which clearly establishes the mandate of the Why are we here together? We agreed on the one hand to start the work of this action group reinforced to develop a protocol, other legal instrument or a Conclusion agreed with legal force in the framework of the Convention that be applicable to all Parties, period. This process should not be wrong interpreted and we are concerned that some countries have interpreted the itself, as a mandate to change the Convention, its principles and including its annexes and that the discussion be conducted in this way without real solutions. The aforementioned decision also details that the work of this group should include work related to adaptation, financing, technology development and transfer, the transparency of measures and provision of support and capacity-building. For this reason, we express that the result of the ADP should not focus on legally binding mitigation commitments, regardless the means of implementation of the Convention. Another point that is important to specify are the commitments that each country has in the Convention, for which I allow myself to remember your article 4 in which it clearly indicates the differentiation between what all Parties should do and what developed country Parties are committed to do. Additionally, we must express our concern when some of the positions presented in the sessions of this group suggest that we ignore another vital article importance in the Convention the same one that I allow myself to remember in detail and especially so that developed countries can remember it clearly: The extent to which developing country Parties lead to the effectively practice its commitments under the Convention will depend on the way in which developed country Parties effectively implement their commitments regarding financial resources and technology transfer, and you will have fully bear in mind that economic and social development and eradication of poverty are the first and essential priorities of developing country Parties. Mr President, there is a historical debt and we must not deceive ourselves think that the same development opportunities have come for all and that we must disappear the emissions history as suggested in the previous meeting of this group held in this same city. Doing this would not be in accordance with the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities, ratified even by our heads of state at the Rio+20 Conference. ALBA is concerned that we continue to put at risk our Mother Earth, our Nature, a place where it reproduces and realizes life and you have the right to be protected in a way integral, as well as their existence and regeneration of their life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes. In this sense, the change climate threatens the rights of all human beings and the nature and its basic right of protection. We feel it is our duty to remind all Parties that the Kyoto Protocol was to help meet the ultimate goal of the Convention, and still must. In this way, the entry into force immediate second commitment period and review of the level of Your Parties ambition in 2014 is absolutely CRUCIAL. Mr. President, we want to invite all States Part of this Convention to respect its objectives, mandates and agreements in accordance with the provisions of pacta sunt servanda, so that we can ensure that future human lives have the same and better quality and opportunities that we have had. The people of our countries have this right and for those people sir ALBA President expresses his commitment to work and continue contributing in the discussion under this group. Thank you Mr. President.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of 44 countries that are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS aligns itself with the statement made by Fiji on behalf the Group of 77 and China, and the statements made by Nepal on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group and Swaziland on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you again for your leadership. You have set the stage for us to make substantial progress at this session and beyond, and I assure you of our continued support as we work to close the emissions gap and fulfill the ultimate objective of the Convention. Our work this session must be motivated by a renewed sense of urgency, bearing in mind that time is running out for the countries I represent. Scientists have confirmed that unless we dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term, well before 2020, the opportunity to keep global warming below the 1.5-degree threshold that is essential to ensure the survival of all our members may be irrevocably lost. Thus in ADP Workstream 2, we must promote opportunities to mitigate by focusing on specific mitigation policies and actions that have the greatest promise, are cost effective and scalable. Then, we must enable interested Parties to deploy these immediately, by engaging those with on-the-ground expertise in the development and implementation of successful mitigation actions, and by overcoming barriers to implementation, such as the delivery of scaled-up financial resources, technology, and capacity building. We were grateful for the broad support our Workstream 2 non-paper enjoyed at the last session and look forward to elaborating on it further this session. As I said, concrete progress on Workstream 2 is required to prevent a catastrophe for us all, particularly the most vulnerable. It is also important to remember that a failure to close the mitigation ambition gap by acting decisively now will have profound implications for the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 agreement. We know that effectively dealing with climate change will demand a sustained effort for decades to come so discussions under Workstream 1 of the ADP must also be ambitious enough to protect the interests of future generations as well as our own. It is the view of AOSIS that the outcome of the process launched in Durban should be a Protocol under the Convention applicable to all Parties, to be adopted no later than 2015. As we continue to develop the core elements of the new legally binding agreement, we should build on the foundations of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, including their fundamental principles and provisions. The new legally binding agreement should be based on the best available science, strengthen the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, and ensure the survival of the most vulnerable. Co-Chairs, In addition to other key elements raised in the co-chairs note, elements that AOSIS sees as absolutely essential to the ADP agreement include: mitigation ambition at a scale that can keep warming well below 1.5 degrees Celsius; a mechanism to address Loss and Damage; and a compliance system to give confidence that the commitments of all Parties will be met. We urge world leaders to work expeditiously to generate the political will required for us to be successful. We welcomed the announcement made by UN Secretary-General Ban that he will convene a leaders summit in 2014 and see it as an important decision point for Parties, with developed countries taking the lead by putting forward more ambitious targets using the 2014 Kyoto Protocol ratchet mechanism and for non-KP Parties to make comparable commitments. We must all work together to raise ambition to the scale and on the timeframe needed to tum us away from disaster. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Co-Chairs. I have the privilege of delivering this statement.  We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China We acknowledge the sterling efforts of the Co-Chairs in advancing the work of this subsidiary body since last year. We hope that this session, which will mark the end of tenure for the two Co-Chairs, will result in tangible progress and guide the future work under the ADP process. Mr. Co-Chairs, As we resume our work in this second part of the second session of the ADP, we fully trust that the Co-Chairs will permeate balance in all aspects of work under the ADP keeping in view that the April and June session are to seen as parts of a whole. Mr. Co-Chairs, We reaffirm that the objective of the Durban Platform negotiations is to further strengthen the multilateral rule-based climate regime, ensuring the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. The Durban Platform is by no means a process to negotiate a new regime, nor to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or reinterpret but should rather reaffirm the Convention and apply its principles and provisions. Both the process and the outcome of the Durban Platform are under the Convention and must fully adhere to all its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Mr. Co-Chairs, We stress that the work of Durban Platform cannot be carried out in a vaccum. It must be based on and build on the work carried out by Parties under the Bali Road Map. As agreed in its mandate under para 6 of decision 1/CP.17, the work of ADP must be informed by IPCC, The 2013-15 Review and the subsidiary bodies. The work under ADP must therefore evolve on the basis of information received from these bodies. To this end, the ADP must institutionalise a mechanism for receiving and accounting for regular and comprehensive feedback from the respective subsidiary bodies/mechanisms. It is also important that technical work in the subsidiary bodies be formalised in decisions, to record progress between now and 2015. Mr. Co-Chairs, The work of Durban Platform is a comprehensive process, covering mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building and transparency must address the issues related to these pillars of the Convention in a holistic, balanced and coordinated manner. The enhanced actions under the Durban Platform should translate into enhanced actions under each of the pillars identified in para 5 of decision 1/CP.17 i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building and transparency. In our work in June session and beyond we need to bring more focus to structuring our discussions on each of these pillars in a much more organized manner. These focused discussions are necessary to find convergence on enhanced actions that are central to the ADP outcome. Mr. Co-Chairs, We stressed that the pre-2020 ambition should primarily be addressed in the context of actions of parties under KP CP2 and the agreed outcome pursuant to Bali Action Plan and in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. The low levels of Annex I ambition under both Kyoto Protocol and the Convention remains a matter of grave concern. There is evidently a huge ambition gap between what developed country Parties have pledged and what is required by science and their historical responsibility. Therefore, we underline that the developed countries who have taken commitments under the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol must raise their ambition level in 2014 in consonance with science and their historical responsibility. At the same time, they strongly emphasized that developed countries which are not part of Kyoto Protocol or have not joined the 2nd commitment period must equally raise their ambition in the same timeframe and take on comparable mitigation commitments under the Convention. The gap can rather be overachieved if developed countries demonstrate the lead and scale up ambition not just in mitigation but also in provision of enabling financial resources, environmentally sound technologies and capacity building to support mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries. This will necessitate early and meaningful operationalization of the mechanisms set up in recent years to support developing countries in particular the GCF. Mr. Co-Chairs, We cannot fully stress the importance of capitalisation of the GCF as a means of restoring trust and building momentum for the ADP. In this regard, the operationalization of Technology Mechanism and Adaptation Committee are also important. Mr. Co-Chairs, BASIC re-iterates its full support to the Co-Chairs in advancing the work of ADP in an open, transparent, party-driven and inclusive manner. I thank you, Mr Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Chair, Please Allow me first to express on behalf of Cartagena Dialogue Bangladesh\\'s trust upon you as the chair of this session. We believe that under your leadership, and that of our other Chairs in this process, we will have a clearer road map to reach our common goal of a climate-safe world. Mr. Chair, Countries of the Cartagena Dialogue for Progressive Action met from 8 to 10 April 2013 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A representative of the UNFCCC Secretariat was also present at the meeting. Mr. Chair, The clock is ticking and the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has already reached 400 ppm. The Cartagena Dialogue assumes added importance in this situation as the members of the Cartagena Dialogue are committed domestically with their respective capabilities to pursue low carbon economic and development pathways, and also committed to pursuing global action through a legally binding international agreement applicable to all. The Dhaka meeting provided an informal space for these countries to work together, within and across regional groupings and traditional negotiating blocks towards - an ambitious and effective legally binding new agreement; building political momentum for increased pre-2020 ambition; and - sustaining momentum in the implementation of a climate action through the UNFCCC, including through the important work of the Subsidiary Bodies. The meeting highlighted the importance of operationalising the newly created frameworks, mechanisms, institutions and processes in an expeditious manner with a view to strengthening the existing and future climate change management. It was underscored that the implementation issues are crucially important to build mutual trust and confidence. Delegates also felt it important for maintaining effectively linkages between discussions under the SBs and the ADP, so that existing processes, institutions and frameworks, etc. can add value to ADP process, particularly in relation to mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency. Building on this foundation, participants considered that the 2015 agreement should create an effective, robust, multilateral rules-based regime. They underlined the importance of ensuring effective climate action, as called for by climate science, and ensuring universal participation on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and differing national circumstances, supported by means of implementation where needed. Ideas were explored around a spectrum of commitments to allow for action by all Parties in line with their differing capabilities. Participants also discussed the importance of building the appropriate implementation conditions to allow greater pre-2020 ambition. Focusing on low-hanging mitigation potential was emphasized, as well as the importance of supplementary initiatives outside of the UNFCCC without prejudice to the Convention process. It was also recognized that Ministerial engagement on pre2020 ambition would be essential at COP 19 and at the upcoming summit called by the UN Secretary General. It is expected that the institutional mechanisms and Implementation frameworks in progress in the Subsidiary Bodies and the COP, would contribute to creating the right conditions for enhanced action without further delay. Mr. Chair, Meetings such as the Cartagena Dialogue that we have recently hosted are important to better understand Parties positions and work in the best spirit of cooperation to find common ground for action by all. We must all work together if we are to address the root cause and challenges of climate change and keep warming to below at least two degrees Celsius. We cannot afford to delay action any longer since our existence as humanity is at stake.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. When we met just over a month ago, we had open and productive conversations on the new global agreement, and on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. These allowed us to make real progress understanding each others interests and ideas for advancing a practical, ambitious global multilateral rules-based framework on climate change. As we said in May, we need solutions that can strengthen the UNFCCC legal framework for the challenges of a new century, and promote national action and development co-benefits. We look forward to continuing discussion in the same spirit at this session. Our ideas are maturing, and areas of potential convergence are becoming more clear. We look forward to further discussions, at this session, on the scope, structure and design of the new agreement, including issues such as: How we could define a spectrum of commitments, What elements could ensure the transparency, ambition and fairness of those commitments, What is the best way to promote and support implementation; How adaptation should be reflected in the new agreement, and Use of flexible mechanisms for meeting commitments. On the ambition workstream, we would like to see, as we did at the meeting in May, concrete and practical discussion identifying where there is potential to scale up action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that would help countries individually and collectively to do more. We also hope the ADP discussions can help create an environment which encourages the 100-odd countries that have not yet made a 2020 pledge, to do so, and an environment that incentivises those with pledges to raise their ambition. As we consider ways to raise mitigation ambition, we must continue to explore complementary initiatives alongside the UNFCCC, and use their potential for enhanced action on mitigation pre 2020. And we must continue engaging key nonParty actors, including representatives from sub-national bodies, civil society and the private sector, who are the key agents of action on the ground, to support Parties in their actions.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of LDC Group. We associate ourselves with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of G77 and China, Swaziland on behalf of the Africa Group and Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. Co-Chairs, the current gap in mitigation ambition places us on track for a 4 degree plus world. We all arrived in Bonn as the atmospheric C02 concentration surpassed the 400 ppm mark. Allowing the concentration to increase further is suicidal with catastrophic implications. In the midst of these challenges, however, we have another historic opportunity to strengthen the current climate regime by adopting a new Protocol applicable to all Parties in 2015. We urge all Parties not to lose sight of this goal. Achievement of the 2?C goal, agreed under the Convention, leading towards 1.5 degrees requires ambitious reductions of global greenhouse emissions by all Parties, and this should have already begun. We are behind schedule, and time is not our side. Co-Chairs, moving forward under both the ADP workstreams with a balanced and focused approach is fundamental to a mutually agreed outcome and this session must provide a positive momentum for Warsaw. Under Workstream 1: We are concerned by the discussions during the roundtables at the last session, moving toward locking some Parties in a vicious circle 0k low ambition under an unsustainable bottom-up approach. As we all know, the 2015 agreement would be meaningful only if it is based on a clear science-based approach; and is consistent with the objective of the Convention. The LDCs welcome the proposal to hold a workshop on adaptation. This is an extremely important element of the ADP. We expect to clarify the added value of the new treaty for adaptation, particularly for developing countries. We are eager to provide you with ideas for incorporating adaptation within the legal agreement. In addition, we propose holding a focused workshop on the role of means of implementation to trigger effective climate actions in developing countries. We also believe the International Mechanism on Loss and Damage should be incorporated within a new legal agreement. We will also provide you with ideas on how this could be achieved. Co-chairs, we urgently need to change our mode of operation to commence work on developing the new legal agreement. We encourage you to focus the discussions towards that end and start calling for proposals on legal form in subsequent discussions in Warsaw to meet a deadline of adopting a Protocol by 2015. Co-Chairs, we are happy that you have prioritized the Workstream 2 discussions on mitigation options that could have win-win benefits, especially those that have co-benefits for development and adaptation. We are happy with the proposed workshop on energy. The Technical paper by the Secretariat on compilation of information on mitigation benefits shows that there is high potential to close the ambition gap, but that window of opportunity is closing very fast. We need to be focused and outcome-oriented under this workstream. This outcome needs to be reflected by: a. enhanced pledges by Annex I KP Parties through the KP review process by 2014; b. moving the Annex I Party commitments under the Convention towards the upper end of the range, and c. enhanced NAMAs by developing countries We would like to remind all Parties that the assurance for additional pre-2020 mitigation ambition through Workstream 2 is a key element of the Durban package and that the work under Workstream 2 determines the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 Protocol. Co-Chairs, building trust as well as building upon the existing foundations is critical to deliver the results mandated in this process. To this extent, developed countries must show leadership by raising their ambition as well as mobilizing resources for developing countries. We reiterate the importance for developed countries to talce a leadership in ratifying the amendments of the Kyoto Protocol as early as possible. We once again urge all Parties to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible. Co-Chairs, we wish to ex\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs The Group of 77 and China is happy that we are continuing our work in this second part of the second resumed session and I give you the assurance that we are ready to engage cooperatively with all Parties in this working Group to ensure the successful accomplishment of the mandate that we have given ourselves to achieve. The G77 and China wishes to highlight the following: First, it reiterates the six points raised at the April session on behalf of the Group as the Group position on ADP; The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles. and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; d. The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. The decisions of Durban and Doha provide the mandate for the work of the ADP and the Group emphasizes that we need a balanced approach to our work. In the work of the ADP the leadership of developed countries is critical. Members of the G77 and China are prepared to do our part, developed parties need to demonstrate their leadership. The Group is also of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. Indeed, it should strengthen the multilateral rule-based regime in order for the Convention to achieve its ultimate objective. In addition, the Group of 77 and China applauds the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Our efforts should now be focused on bringing those amendments into effect at the earliest opportunity. We therefore urge all Parties to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible. Mr. Co-Chairs With those words you are assured of the Group cooperation and we are looking forward to engaging meaningfully with all our partners these two weeks. Thank you Mr. Chairman\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-chairs, PNG has the honor to speak on behalf of the 52 countries of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, of which the following have endorsed this statement. Mr. Co-Chairs, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from the Republic of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chairs, we came to Bonn determined to intensify our work, and we re-affirm our commitment to this objective. While we recognize the value of the open and frank exchange of views among Parties under the round-table format of last year, it is now time to shift gears. A single Contact Group should be established as soon as possible for each workstream so that transparency, inclusiveness and effectiveness are ensured and that clear decisions are adopted as to the structure and contents of the 2015 agreement due to come into force at the latest by 2020. Mr. Co-chairs, the 2015 agreement should be applicable to all Parties, respect the principles of the Convention, take into account the latest scientific information and include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by developed country Parties. Mr. Co-chairs, the current pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions presented by developed country Parties are far inadequate and insufficient. This is why the focus of the second contact group should be on identifying actions that can close the ambition gap with a view to ensuring that the highest possible mitigation efforts are undertaken by all Parties. Mr. Co-chairs, REDD+ has the potential to contribute more than 15 percent to the global mitigation solution. For this reason, REDD+ actions must assume a primary role in enhancing the level of ambition. To fulfill this objective and promote the contribution of REDD+ actions in achieving global emission reductions targets, developed countries should provide financial and technical support to developing countries with the aim to quantify the mitigation potential of REDD+ activities. Mr. Co-Chairs, we are ready, as usual, to cooperate with all Parties under your able leadership, with the view to finalize a robust and ambitious new regime for climate change before 2015. Thank you Mr. Co-chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. co-Chairs. I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, its 27 Member States and Croatia. Under the ADP decisions in Durban and Doha, we agreed to work towards a single, fair and comprehensive, legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties by 2015. We acknowledged the urgent need to close the pre-2020 mitigation gap to keep the below 2?C goal within reach. As we resume our work following the very positive and constructive engagement by all Parties in April, we agree with your assessment that the goals set out for that session were met. Now we need go one step further and urgently advance our work in order to fulfil the tasks we set ourselves in Durban - 2015 is around the comer. We must use this session to prepare for the outcomes we want to see in Warsaw. Key objective for the session Mr. co-Chairs, we fully support the goal of this session, set out in your informal note, to further focus our work in particular, by engaging on topics where differences can be bridged and where the common ground we ve identified can be further expanded. Under workstream one, we welcome the opportunity to further discuss the steps that we will need to take together to devise an agreement that includes mitigation commitments for all in such a way that is fair and reflects evolving economic realities and development opportunities for all Parties, consistent with the need to keep the global temperature increase below 2?C. The EU has recently made a submission that we hope provides ideas on how we could adopt an ambitious rules-based agreement in 2015. In addition to getting a clearer picture on the process going forward, we will need to elaborate on the elements of the 2015 agreement in order to facilitate movement towards the preparation of draft text at the end of 2014. We need to make progress on this in Bonn, and Warsaw needs to capture this progress. In this regard, we support the elements you have identified for discussion in the roundtables and we welcome also the workshop on adaptation in the 2015 agreement as a means of gaining clarity on what outcomes Parties might like to see on this important issue. We also welcome, and consider it appropriate at this joint session with the SBs, to look at how the 2015 agreement will connect with existing institutions under the KP and the Convention. The technical work being carried out in the SBs is vital to the on-going implementation of our agreements to date and will continue to be of significant importance in underpinning the elements of the 2015 agreement. It is important to build on what we have, but at the same time we must be efficient and not duplicate existing processes or institutions. Under workstream 2, we need to continue our work on identifying concrete actions that will help us close the gap between what s\"',\n",

Mr. President, the SICA countries have expectations of the effectiveness of the Working Group of the Durban Platform for Expanded Action ADP) and we call for the establishment of a single contact group and not for the agenda of the ADP since this will allow us to systematically, effectively and purposefully follow up on the development of these negotiations. Our region is strongly committed to contributing to the achievement of concrete results of the ADP in its work agenda on the vision and ambition for mitigation, adaptation, financing, development and transfer of technology, transparency of action and the support and construction of capabilities. Mr. President, our region demands in these meetings to advance in the identification of options for a detailed framework of actions that can contribute to closing the pre-2020 ambition gap and the financial gap based on concrete commitments that demonstrate the leadership of developed countries. ; as well as the establishment of the central elements for the negotiating text to be considered during COP 20 The SICA countries consider it a priority that during these sessions the foundations are laid for an ambitious, lasting and effective agreement to be agreed in 2015, and that it reflects the necessary balance in adaptation and mitigation actions. The agreement should also facilitate support and flexibility in the face of different national circumstances and be based on transparency to verify compliance with commitments and financial contributions, especially by the countries in Annex 1. For our region, it is urgent to incorporate supervision, monitoring and verification mechanisms applicable to the commitments of implementing mitigation, financing, adaptation and technological transfer actions in Annex 1 countries. Mr. President, the ADP must work intensively to increase the level of ambition, especially of the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol for Annex 1 countries and to promote comparable voluntary efforts for developed countries that are not part of the Protocol. Likewise, within the framework of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the countries with the lowest historical responsibility for emissions must guarantee their right to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. In this sense, we highlight the need to have mechanisms that ensure the proper performance of institutional arrangements or an international mechanism for the recognition and compensation of losses and damages caused by climate change. Mr. President, our region has been promoting important national efforts and actions to reduce vulnerability to climate change and improve our adaptation capacities. Likewise, we have been investing our own resources to support the reduction of emissions with voluntary mitigation measures that should be valued as contributions to global efforts and to the level of ambition that we demand be increased by developed countries. The SICA countries in the face of the Post 2015 Agreement support the need to strengthen, improve and put into operation legally binding mechanisms for emissions reduction commitments and the adaptation of financial resources to implement adaptation and mitigation actions that guarantee us to maintain the temperature below 1.5 degrees C. In this sense, we make an urgent call to establish a roadmap on sustainable, predictable and additional financing for medium and long-term development aid, with goals for 2020 and post 2020 that support the efforts of the region. and from developing countries. At the same time, we consider that public financing should be given priority in this effort, promoting 2 private financing with social responsibility in a complementary way. Finally, the SICA countries before the Post 2020 Agreement-highlight the need for it to have solid mechanisms for supervision and monitoring of the provision of financing, so that they are appropriate to the level of commitments assumed by the parts that are developing countries. For these purposes, an efficient MRV mechanism must be adopted for the contribution of implementation medicines provided by developed countries, and thus all contribute to the fundamental objective of the convention and to be able to live in harmony with mother earth. Mr. President, Thank you very much.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chair, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. As we all know, concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has surpassed 400 parts per million. In that sense the EIG reiterates that mitigation is a necessity and not a break to development but an opportunity for wellbeing. Mr. Co-Chair, we have no time to lose. The 2015 Agreement must provide a clear message to Parties and to the private actors that the future are low carbon economies, and establish robust and predictable legally binding mechanisms for action. Pre-2020 ambition is fundamental for the transformation into a low carbon future. Sufficient level of ambition needs political willingness and a fair and dynamic differentiation between Parties according to common but dfferentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Therefore, under workstream 1: we must particularly advance on the common understanding on fair differentiation under the Convention; the formulation of mitigation commitments by all Parties, including targets or actions; the process accompanying the formulation of commitments; and on internationally determined rules for accounting and transparency underlying these mitigation commitments; further, on the elements of the 2015 Agreement to empower Parties in the adaptation efforts; the design of the 2015 Agreement to catalyze means of implementation and climate friendly investments, ensuring both a fair burden sharing and targeted support for effective action to those who need such support; and finally, how to best build on the existing institutional arrangements in view of these elements; Mr. Co-Chair, we must urgently deliver on the commitments under the 2015 Agreement, but, at the same time, we must allow for sufficient time to determine the commitments in a meaningful manner, develop common underlying rules for accounting and MRV and get a clear understanding on the legally binding framework and timeframe in which the commmitments will be anchored. Under workstream 2: we have to recognize current action and encourage Parties to further engage in mitigation, through reduction potentials at national level as well as in the framework of international cooperation. Cooperative action at international level covers a wide range of actions and sectors able to involve all Parties. Further, the EIG would like to underline the importance of the other ongoing processes relevant for success under workstreams 1 and 2 of the ADP. This includes: the clarification of the 2020-pledges, supporting the needs for implementation and progress in the understanding and predictability of mobilisation of climate finance. Especially, the EIG countries emphasize the urgency of the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund. We are concerned and disappointed by the slow progress in this regard and urge to advance on the open issues by COP19. We have benefited from your wisdom, your supportive and clear leadership, and the constructive setting in which you have stirred our work. Mr Co-chairs, we all would like to thank you for this The informal round-tables and workshops have proven to be effective for the first part of our work at hand. At one moment, we may have to move into a different, more formal working modality, which is clearly reflecting the two distinct work streams through two formal working groups. It may well be that the COP in Warsaw may be the right movement for this step. On a final note, Mr Co-Chairs, the EIG would like to suggest to consider to suspend the ADP at this session and thus to allow the focused and productive work that we started in April to continue. We encourage you, Mr. Co-Chairs, to capture further progress achieved over the next two weeks in summaries, including outlining the areas of deepened common ground. Such organisation under the ADP will allow seemsless transition of the chairmenship to the new Co-Chairs to be elected here in Bonn. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chair\"',\n",
              "       '\"Sudan has the honour to deliver this opening statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries in Climate Change LMDC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji. The group looks forward to continuing our work in the ADP. We must urgently act to address the climate change crisis and protect the integrity of Mother Earth under the Convention. Developing countries are well aware of this and are doing a large number of climate change mitigation and adaptation actions domestically to implement the Convention. Mr. Co-Chair You sent to Parties your informal notes on your perception and understanding of the discussions from the various roundtables at the first half of this session. Unfortunately, we have reservations on the annexes to the informal note. There was no engagement between or consensus among the Parties on these. There cannot be convergence on selective issues that portray a skewed picture of ADP progress. Convergence can be based on the ADP s mandate from Durban and Doha for enhanced action under the four main pillars of the Convention. Discussing these annexes will only distract us from moving forward in the ADP. The technical note of the Secretariat fai ls to fully capture the views of developing countries. This lack of balance concerns us. It cannot carry any legal weight in the ADP process or negotiations. Equitable and durable win-win-win solutions for the people, the climate, and sustainable development under the Convention cannot be achieved by wasting time discussing some new concepts and ideas deviating from, renegotiating, rewriting, replacing, restricting, and reinterpreting, the principles, provisions, and structure of the Convention. The ADP should instead advance its work through constructive, progressive, and positive engagement by all Parties in accordance with its mandate. On this, we wish to make three points: Mr. Co-Chair First, Workstreams I and 2 must have a balanced approach. Annex I Parties should immediately take the lead in showing pre-2020 ambition. Annex l KP Parties must immediately ratify the KP amendment for the 2nd commitment period, increase their QELROs substantially, and remove any conditions for doing so. Non-KP Annex 1 Parties should make comparable unconditional increases in their mitigation targets under the Bali Action Plan outcome. These should be done no later than April 2014. Annex II parties should also show increased ambition by fully financing mitigation projects, including those already in the CDM pipeline amounting to 6 gigatons of reductions), in developing countries regardless of the carbon price and without seeking to get emission reduction credits for doing so. A successful outcome in Workstream 2 in filling implementation gaps and increasing pre2020 ambition lays the basis for achieving future success in Workstream 1 for post-2020 enhanced action under the Convention. The selection of themes for the round tables and workshops must be balanced and comprehensive, and reflect the different elements within the two Workstreams. Specific themes are needed on enhanced provision of finance and on enhanced technology development and transfer, including removal of barriers. Themes that do not reflect the agreed elements of the Workstreams, such as investments and enabling environment for such investments, divert us from the problem of the inadequate provision of financing and technology from developed to developing countries under the Convention. Under Workstream 1, there should be workshops on enhancing the provision of the finance and technology support from developed countries to developing countries, and a roundtable on how developed countries take the lead after 2020. Under Workstream 2, the equity issue and increasing the pre-2020 ambition on finance and technology support from developed countries should also have workshops. We are concerned and find unacceptable those proposals which seek to discuss a selective list of issues as sectoral activities under Workstream 2, some of which imply imposing additional burdens on developing countries contrary to both the letter and spirit of the Convention. Any shift in approach in Workstream 2 away from the Convention approach, such as a result-oriented approach, endangers the process. It is only the Convention approach - where developed countries take the lead and support developing countries in implementing the Convention - that will give positive results. Mr. Co-Chair Second, the four pillars of the Convention must now be dealt with in a more organized and structured way, consistent with the mandate of the ADP from Durban and Doha. Both paragraph 5, decision 1 /CP.17, and paragraph 6, decision 2/CP.18, laid out the scope and the elements to be covered as part of the plan of work of the ADP under Workstream 1. These elements are: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building. We should focus on these existing common ground elements, and build on them as integral, comprehensive, holistic, and interlinked components of the outcome of the ADP by 201 S. Based on the four pillars of the Convention and the agreed elements from Durban and Doha, the ADP negotiations should address the following: enhanced Annex 1 mitigation commitments; enabled and supported non-Annex I nationally appropriate mitigation actions; enhanced action and support to adaptation in developing countries and an effective international mechanism on loss and damage; the enhanced provision of finance, including for technology development and transfer; enhanced technology access, transfer, and development, including through removal of barriers such as intellectual property rights; enhanced capacity building from developed countries to developing countries; forest activities, including through non-market-based mechanisms; effectively addressing the economic and social consequences of response measures on developing countries; and transparency and compliance. Mr. Co-Chair Third, process shapes and can affect the legitimacy and credibility of the outcome. The negotiations must be open, transparent, Party-driven, fully participatory, and provide mutual benefits for all. Enhanced developing country participation, including of LDCs and SIDS, in the process must be fully supported through additional funding. The negotiating approach, pace, and procedural and substantive progress of all issues and their elements must be appropriately sequenced and balanced, based on the four pillars of the Convention. The chairs of the Convention s other subsidiary bodies, including SBI, SBST A, GCF, SCF, TEC, CTCN, LTF, Adaptation Committee, should periodically brief the ADP. Finally, Co-Chairs, rest assured that our group, as individual Parties and as part of the Group of 77 and China, will continue to work constructively and positively with you at this session, your successors, and all Parties of the Convention. Thank you, Co-Chairs\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Chairman, Distinguished delegates, Armenia has the honor to speak on behalf of the Group of the mountainous landlocked developing countries MLDC). Our group with satisfaction took a note of the results, of the April session, which facilitated intensive, open and constructive exchange of opinions, ideas and views. It is getting obvious that we should start to undertake our utmost, introduce radical measures which are grounded on existing principles and provisions and targeting the ultimate goal of the Convention, inter alia, decrease emissions of greenhouse gases and facilitate adaptation to climate change. Adaptation to climate change is a priority task to our group of countries due to high vulnerability of mountain ecosystems to climate change implications and their geographic location in the arid zone - with no access to the sea. The most vulnerable sectors for us are agriculture, water resources, natural ecosystems, biodiversity and hydroenergy. The Group called for an urgent and broader application of the ecosystem approach. As this approach, among other things, establishes favorable conditions to tackle uncertainties in running realistic forecasts of climate change implications and provides synergies with other global and regional environmental conventions. However the concerns with regard to availability of relevant funding for adaptation purposes still remain. Price reduction in the carbon market makes us search for other alternative sources for the Adaptation Fund, to enable access of other developing countries to the adaptation financial sources vis-a-vis the specificity and vulnerability of countries ecosystems. Regarding the Law Carbon development mountainous landlocked developing countries considers the common, but differentiate responsibility to be maintained given the different levels of historical responsibility and geographic and development specifics. Our group of countries with adequate financial and technical support from developed countries and following axiomatic and principles of the green economy are ready to take certain quantitative commitments not for reduction, but for limitation of the growth of greenhouse gas emissions relative to current emissions by gradually reducing the carbon intensity of GDP. Presently our countries are at the stage of formulation and approval of our national plans on adaptation, the national strategies and the plans of action, targeting the decrease of greenhouse gases emissions by 2015. The ecosystem approach in combination with concept of the green economy, adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Rio-de-Janeiro in June 2012, allows in many sectors to combine actions on mitigation with those on adaptation. This will significantly increase the effectiveness of actions to address climate change and therefore this approach deserves special attention and priority. Finally, our Group stands ready to work with all member countries with the mutual understanding and cooperation to reach our common goals. Thank you for your attention\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, Swaziland, on behalf of the African Group, would like to associate with the statement made by Fiji on behalf G77 and China. Thank you Co-Chairs, we greatly appreciate the leadership you have provided for the ADP over the last year. We feel that, under your guidance, the ADP has advanced its work, and there is a good basis for our work at CoP19 in Warsaw, this coming November. Co-Chairs, as Parties, we have reaffirmed that the 2015 Agreement is not an opportunity to renegotiate the Convention, its principles and annexes, but rather a time to define implementation beyond 2020. The Africa Group welcomes the reflections made, and conclusions drawn in respect of technical paper on adaptation, as an initial step towards the definition of global goal for adaptation. We would further emphasize the importance of science and equity as being central drivers for an effective agreement. Our efforts in the future agreement cannot be complete if we do not understand the implications of temperature goal on both adaptation and mitigation needs. We would further find it difficult to understand the required finance and technological needs to achieve the global effort. Co-Chairs, we request the Secretariat to arrange the revised technical paper on mitigation, based on reflecting the well-considered views by all Parties, that the actions towards mitigation ambition should reflect information on, - the applicability of the principles of the Convention, - the adaptation and mitigation benefits of actions, barriers and means of addressing them as well as incentives - finance, technology, and capacity building to support implementation. It is our view, that we have started engaging on the mitigation benefits, and considered barriers and incentives to these actions, but we have a lot of work to do in respect of the application of the Convention s principles and implementation support to these proposed initiatives. In conclusion Co-Chairs, the process to explore linkages with existing institutions of the Convention, and the work under the Subsidiary Bodies on finance and mitigation leadership by developed countries doe not only provide perspectives for the future agreement, but build the necessary trust and confidence as we negotiate the 2015 Agreement. Co-Chairs, we thank you for your leadership, and wish in-coming Co-Chairs success, wisdom. On behalf of the Africa Group, we pledge our full support and cooperation as you take the work of the ADP forward. Co-Chairs, I thank you\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs I have the honor to take the floor on behalf of the Arab Group comprising the 22 member states of the League of Arab States. Let me first start by associating the Arab Group with the statement. The Arab group extends to you its full appreciation for the effective and cordial manner in which you have led our work for the past year. You have successfully steered our deliberations and promoted a constructive dialogue that will no doubt represent an important basis for the collective efforts to herald a new phase of the international climate regime. We do thank you for your leadership and we welcome the incoming co-chairs and wish them the best and commit to extend to them the same support and cooperation. Co-Chairs As we conclude this resumed second session of the ADP, the Arab Group reaffirms that the international climate regime is grounded on the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and of the KP. Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention represent the basis for international cooperation in the fight against climate change, namely through the principle of CBDR, equity, and the responsibility for historical emissions, and the absolute priority for developing countries to achieve sustainable development and pove1ty eradication in line with their national strategies and priorities. Our work in the ADP should not attempt to reinterpret or renegotiate the Convention principles, provisions, and structure, including its annexes, but instead should be grounded on them and they should be reemphasized in any 2015 outcome we reach. Co-chairs Our objective should be the full and sustained implementation of the Convention, through the full implementation of the outcomes emanating from the Bali processes and the Durban and Doha decisions. Our work in the ADP shall be informed, in particular, of the progress in implementation of the commitments made in Durban and Doha relative to the second commitment period of the KP and the implementation and delivery of com111itments in the areas of adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. We reaffirm that merely creating new institutions is not enough, but should be translated into concrete timebound deliverables for adaptation and mitigation. Co-Chairs The Arab Group believes that the 2015 outcome should not be mitigation-centered but should integrate all adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building, and transparency of actions and support. There is a need to bridge all the ambition gaps that presently exist with the same level of seriousness. We call for balance between the two ADP workstreams, and affirm that success in WS 2 is essential to instill a sense of trust and momentum for the success of W~ 1. Annex 1 countries members of the KP are called upon to urgently complete their ratification of the second commitment period, and revise their mitigation ambition upward in 2014. Non- KP Annex 1 countries or Annex 1 countries that chose not to be part of the second commitment period of the KP are called upon to exert comparable emission reduction efforts. We call on Annex 1 countries to take the lead in combating climate change and to fulfill their legal obligations to provide the means of implementation to developing countries. Like other developing countries groupings, the Arab group calls for equal emphasis be given to both mitigation and adaptation. We believe that any contribution by developing countries to the international mitigation effort must be nationally-determined and in the context of national circumstances, be grounded on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and not be to the detriment of their sustainable development priorities. We also support the request to examine the level of adaptation required for every temperature scenario and of the commensurate levels of finance and technology transfer needed by developing countries. In addition, we urge for swift progress in the operationalization of all the institutions created since Cancun, including in particular the Green Climate Fund. There is indeed an urgent need for a clear road map for achieving the goal of mobilizing 100 billion dollars per year from 2020, and for clarity on the level of finance between 2013 and 2020. The Arab group also calls on all sides to desist from unilateral trade measures in the name of climate change, and to effectively address the socio-economic impact of response measures on developing countries and assist those countries in need to diversify their economies in order to face the repercussions of climate change. Co-Chairs. The Arab Group will no doubt assume its fair share of the global efforts to combat climate change. Much is already taking place in individual Arab countries to delink their economic development strategies from the growth of their emissions and to implement new and renewable energy strategies. However, Arab countries will not agree with attempts to side-step the principles of the convention, or attempts by some to renege on their legal obligation and to shift their responsibilities to others. In closing, the Arab Group reiterates its commitment to work with all parties towards the success of our collective journey to 2015 so that its outcome responds to the aspirations of the international community, and to realize a shift in the mindset in these international negotiations away from finger pointing to a principled approach grounded on equity and fairness. thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues: Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a group of 44 countries that are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS aligns itself with the statement, and the statements made by Nepal on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group and Swaziland on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs, once again, let me thank you for your leadership and congratulate you on a job well done. You have set the stage for us to make meaningful progress and we assure you and your successors of our continued support in the weeks and months ahead. Moving forward, our work must be guided by the knowledge that unless we dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term, well before 2020, the opportunity to keep global warming below the 1.5-degree threshold may be irrevocably lost. The deadly flooding unfolding here in Germany, as well as the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary is a graphic reminder of what is at stake at these negotiations and our hearts go out to all those impacted. But we remind the parties here that what is at stake for SIDS is existential; once the high watermark is reached for many of our small island nations and coastal communities these waters will never recede. Increasing our collective mitigation ambition is urgently needed. In light of this urgency, we submitted a proposal in line with our mandate from Durban under Workstream 2 to enhance mitigation ambition, to complement the negotiations with a more technical, concrete and collaborative process that creates a space for collective problem-solving. We welcome the constructive engagement of Parties on this new approach. In that light, we welcome the new call to Parties and other stakeholders to make submissions for a second version of the useful technical paper that provided the backdrop for our work in Workstream 2 here in Bonn. We encourage all relevant stakeholders to bring their mitigation strategies and ideas to this process. We have heard many countries underscore the obligation under the convention for developed countries to take the lead in this effort. Central to the AOSIS proposal is a call for developed countries to take the lead, first and foremost, by examining and exploiting their untapped mitigation potential at home through new policies and strategies. These should translate into more ambitious commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, bearing in mind the mechanism we agreed to in Doha to revisit and increase ambition, and would expect other comparably ambitious mitigation targets to come forward under the Convention by 2014 at the latest. We have heard many countries speak of the need to build trust between parties. We believe our proposed approach would do just that by creating a collaborative problem-solving effort where all countries explore the mitigation potential available, identify the actions they want to take and find solutions to make it happen. The process is not intended to create an opportunity for shifting the mitigation burden to developing countries, but it is an opportunity to overcome barriers to implementation, including the matching of enhanced means of implementation with mitigation actions developed in line with national sustainable development priorities, and making best use of the bodies and mechanisms we have developed under the Convention, in particular the GCF. Most importantly, we think this technical work should be undertaken in working groups in the opening days of COP19, and culminate in a Ministerial Roundtable on Enhancing Mitigation Ambition during our second week in Warsaw. Co-Chairs, we know that tackling climate change will require a sustained effort guided by the best science for generations to come. Therefore, Workstream 1 of the ADP must similarly ambitious and aimed at ensuring the survival of all our members. It is the view of AOSIS that the outcome of the process launched in Durban should be a Protocol under the Convention applicable to all Parties, to be adopted no later than 2015. As we continue to develop the core elements of the new legally binding agreement, we should build on the foundations of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, including their fundamental principles and provisions. The new legally binding agreement should strengthen the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, and ensure the survival of the most vulnerable. Being applicable to all, it will require universal participation and contributions from every Party. In addition, with the costs of climate change mounting before our eyes, it is absolutely essential to establish a mechanism to address Loss and Damage in Warsaw and ensure that this mechanism is also appropriately addressed in the context of the 2015 agreement. We urge the incoming Co-Chairs to move us to a more focused method of work in Warsaw so we can accelerate progress towards a new protocol, as our time is limited. For this reason, we welcome the call for at least one extra session to advance progress in 2014. Finally, we know that success here requires the attention and commitment of our leaders at the highest level. We see the UN Secretary-General Ban leaders summit in 2014 as an important decision point for Parties to raise ambition and meet our ultimate objective. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. Co-Chairs, Thinking back on this time last year, we\\'d reflect on just how far we\\'ve come in our work under the ADP, under your guidance. The roundtables and workshops we\\'ve engaged in over the last year provided us with important building blocks for achieving, in 2015 a new agreement applicable to all Parties, and enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. All of us here know how important our mandate is - it is only by taking genuinely global action that we can deliver the objective of the Convention, and avoid real and severe consequences of climate change. Umbrella Group countries understand the role we have in continuing to lead this global endeavour, but meeting the Conventions objective will ultimately depend on ambitious contributions from fill countries. Our efforts must be based on working together. We value the collaborative spirit that Parties have brought to discussions in the ADP. This has helped us identify areas of common understanding and fruitful areas for further work, and as well as understanding areas of difference and potential ways to bridge these. We must continue this positive momentum. Between now and our next meeting in Warsaw, Parties have an opportunity to reflect on what they have heard here, and develop their thinking in greater depth. We encourage all Parties to take advantage of the invitation to prepare submissions, and put forward concrete ideas and proposals that can move work forward. At yesterdays informal plenary we heard a number of Parties identify themes for future work, building on potential common ground. We think this could include: For workstream 1: Elaborating the steps that will help Parties come forward with nationally determined mitigation commitments, that are clear, ambitious and fair Such as up-front transparency measures to ensure commitments are clear and predictable; A consultative process to consider ambition and fairness; And by further considering timing for proposing and considering commitments. We could further consider how a rule-based framework could be developed in a way that is applicable to all and incorporate mitigation efforts of all; We could draw out ideas on how adaptation, and measures to support and advance implementation, can be reflected in a 2015 package; and Have further exchanges on the structure of a 2015 agreement, including how it will interact with related decisions, institutions and infrastructure. For workstream 2, we could: Look further at how mitigation potential in a range of areas can be captured by Parties with diverse national circumstances; drawing on the lessons, practices and technical expertise that Parties and non-Party experts can share; Better understand what will allow Parties who have not yet made a 2020 pledge to do so; and enable higher ambition by those who have pledged; Encourage complementary work alongside the UNFCCC, through international co-operative initiatives, to drive practical action; And ensure that we continue to build and sustain political will and momentum. Warsaw will have a critical role to play in this regard. Umbrella Group countries would like to see focused Ministerial engagement on both workstreams at COP19. This would continue to strengthen the political foundation and direction of work in the ADP with a view to deliver in the agreed timeframe. But equally important will be the opportunity at COP19 to highlight the real action happening in and between countries on the ground. Demonstrating national and international action is what will let us successfully deliver the ADP s mandate. Co-Chairs, We cannot conclude without a final expression of gratitude to you both for your tireless efforts in leading the ADP, and helping us make the progress that we have made. We applaud you both. We also welcome and offer full support to our incoming Co-Chairs, and look forward to continuing the ADP s work under their stewardship. Thank you.\"',\n",

Mr President, we would like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity in the face of the severe floods that affect the center of Europe and in particular the Federal Republic of Germany and to stand in solidarity with the German people and government in their efforts to guarantee the safety of their citizens. and face the damages and losses caused. In the same way we express our solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka to be living a similar situation. We understand the seriousness of the problem as this is a recurring situation in the SICA countries in the context of the high climatic variability that affects us, so we reiterate our call to the international community to redouble efforts to advance in decision-making to ensure reduce the impacts of climate change. Mr. President, the SICA countries recognize the efforts and progress made during these sessions in Bonn by the Working Group of the Durban Platform for Expanded Action ADP) and ratify the need to establish a single contact group that allows our delegations to maintain a systematic and proactive participation in the negotiations, contributing to the ADP agenda on vision and ambition for mitigation, adaptation, financing, development and transfer of technology, transparency of action and support and capacity development. Mr. President, the SICA countries recognize the efforts and progress made during these sessions in Bonn by the Working Group of the Durban Platform for Expanded Action ADP) and ratify the need to establish a single contact group that allows our delegations to maintain a systematic and proactive participation in the negotiations, contributing to the ADP agenda on vision and ambition for mitigation, adaptation, financing, development and transfer of technology, transparency of action and support and capacity development. Mr. President, we require redoubled efforts by all Parties and urgently by developed countries to establish a framework of concrete commitments and actions to address the existing pre-2020 ambition gap and, especially, how to address the gap. financial that is necessary to promote these actions. At the same time, we need to maintain the objective of establishing the central elements of the negotiating text as soon as possible to be analyzed during COP20. An important step in building confidence is the prompt ratification of the second period of the Kyoto Protocol. The SICA countries express our commitment and availability to continue working to lay the foundations for an ambitious, long-lasting and effective 2015 agreement, which must reflect the balance between adaptation and mitigation actions and be flexible in the face of different national circumstances. This agreement must be based on transparency for the final Declaration of SICA-ADP, compliance with the commitments and financial contributions of the Annex 1 countries in matters of mitigation, financing, adaptation and technological transfer, applying mechanisms of supervision, monitoring and verification of the same. Mr. President, we consider that the work of the ADP must guarantee the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and in that sense, we call on Annex 1 countries to increase the level of ambition in the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol and voluntary efforts. comparable for developed countries that are not part of the Protocol. Likewise, we ratify the urgent need to advance in the constitution of an international mechanism for the recognition and compensation of losses and damages, caused by climate change according to the text of the decision adopted in this regard in Doha in such a way as to contribute to maintaining the right to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty in our countries. Mr. President, our region has as a priority to promote national actions for vulnerability reduction and adaptation; however, they have also been systematically promoting voluntary mitigation measures in different sectors and with their own resources, which should be valued as contributions to global efforts to reduce emissions and to the level of ambition that we demand be increased by the countries developed. The countries of SICA demand the need to put in place legally binding mechanisms for emissions reduction commitments that seek to keep the temperature below 1.5 degrees and we require the establishment of a road map before the Post 2015 Agreement. , especially in relation to public financing that must be sustainable, predictable and additional to official development aid. We require concrete goals by 2020 and post 2020 that support the implementation of mitigation actions and the adaptation efforts of our countries. Finally, Mr. President, our countries in relation to the Post 2020 Agreement, express the need for it to have an adequate and effective supervision, monitoring, reporting and verification mechanisms regarding financing and the contribution of means of implementation. that they be provided to developing countries by developed countries and thereby guarantee the necessary efforts to achieve the central objective of the Convention of reducing the harmful impacts of climate change on human activities. Mr. President, Thank you very much\"',\n",
              "       '\"The Group of 77 and China recognizes the progress achieved during this second part of the resumed second session of the ADP. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China appreciates your efforts Co-Chairs, in guiding and facilitating the work of the ADP in a transparent and inclusive manner. On behalf of the Group, I would like to convey our thanks to you, the current Co-Chairs, and, looking ahead, to assure the incoming Co-Chairs, of the Groups continued cooperation and support. The Group of 77 and China believes, however, that much remains to be done. To that end, the Group concurs on the need to convene, in addition to the SBI, SBSTA and COP sessions, at least two more sessions in 2014. In this regard, the Group supports the request to the Secretariat to make the necessary arrangements. The Group of 77 and China strongly believes that the decisions of Durban and Doha provide the mandate for the work of the ADP. In workstream one including inter alia on Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology Development and Transfer, Transparency of Actions and Support, and Capacity Building. On workstream two, on a work plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to identify and to explore options for a range of actions that can close the ambition gap with a view to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts by all Parties. We also underline the high priority that the Group attaches to enhancing actions on adaptation and means of implementation in the work of the ADP. The Group further believes that the work should progress in a more focused and Party, driven mode in Warsaw, and stresses the need to maintain a balance, both in terms of content and progress of the work, in both work, streams. To this end, the Group of 77 and China believes that the six points identified as the Group s position on ADP at the April session remain relevant and bear repeating; i. The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles, and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; ii. The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; iii. The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; iv. The negotiations under the ADP must be a party-driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; v. The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and vi. Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. We look forward to the two technical papers to be prepared by the Secretariat to inform the further work of the ADP. In the work of the ADP under work, stream, the leadership of developed countries is critical. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China expects that the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol enter into force as soon as possible. We therefore urge all Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to undertake the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible, and to increase their mitigation ambition by 2014. We likewise expect non-KP Annex 1 Parties to increase their mitigation ambition in a comparable manner. Members of the Group of 77 and China are already doing their part and prepared to do more, but developed parties need to demonstrate their leadership. The Group is of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. Indeed, it should strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime in order for the Convention to achieve its ultimate objective. Recognizing the importance of the work of other subsidiary bodies for progress in this working group, the Group of 77 and China wishes to express its disappointment and deep concern at the inability of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to begin the work of its 38th session. This delay has the potential to profoundly impact the progress of the work under the ADP. The Group of 77 and China calls on the Chair of the SBI, relevant bodies under the Convention and Parties to resolve this impasse prior to the start of the 39th session of the SBI. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. co-Chairs, Madame Executive Secretary, distinguished delegates and colleagues. Good morning to you all. I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, its 27 Member States and Croatia. We have had good exchanges during the session, building on the spirit of positive engagement of our ADP meeting last month. In particular on workstream 1, we have had further discussions on the steps we need to take to get us from where we are now to adopting by 2015 a single, fair and comprehensive, legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties. The new agreement should be durable and dynamic, capable of evolving and facilitating strengthened action over time to enable us to meet our below 2?C goal. In particular, through the roundtables and workshops Parties have been able to discuss in more detail their ideas and share their expectations. They have emphasised the importance of upfront clarity regarding proposed mitigation commitments; the need for a period to assess whether commitments are individually fair and collectively ambitious enough; and the importance of adaptation and means of implementation. The time to 2015 is short and we must move forward with a sense of urgency. On Workstream 2, we have acknowledged the urgent need to close the pre-2020 mitigation gap to keep the below 2?C goal within reach. We consider that the format of this session has allowed us to have more focussed discussions and get a deeper understanding of each other\\x19s positions. Parties have again shared experiences, good practice examples, identified opportunities and barriers and we have heard from external organisations and initiatives as well as considering the Secretariat technical paper. We have heard proposals building on the themes identified in the technical paper based on Parties\\x19 contributions with the aim of providing an input to Ministerial level discussions on mitigation ambition in Warsaw. Our discussions here have provided much food for thought on both workstreams and we must take time to think and consider how we each can move forward towards Warsaw. As we have said previously, at COP 19 we want to achieve strong deliverables on implementation, substantive and tangible progress on pre-2020 ambition, and a clear pathway for adopting an ambitious legally binding Agreement in 2015. The format of roundtables and workshops has served us well and we would like to see that kind of engagement continue at COP19 alongside any move to a more formal mode. The work we have agreed to undertake between now and Warsaw will be useful to feed into Ministerial level discussions on both workstreams that will deliver the political engagement we need. On Workstream 1, we want to see decisions that capture progress on the scope, structure and design of the 2015 agreement as well as the process to deliver it. On workstream two we need a decision that sets out the need for new pledges; increasing the ambitio\"',\n",
              "       '\"I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the LDC Group. We associate ourselves with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of G77 and China, by Swaziland on behalf of the Africa Group and by Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. Our 850 million people are among the most exposed, the most vulnerable, and the least able to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. In the recent months, reports and researches have clearly shown that our planet is on track for a four-degree temperature increase by the end of the 21st century. This will have detrimental and disruptive consequences on our livelihoods, economies and ecosystems. Co-chairs the related decrease in crop production and water availability, or the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, have the potential to roll back decades of development and trap our populations in hardship and extreme poverty. It is our common responsibility to prevent the adverse impacts of climate change. Only an equitable, ambitious and effective protocol, to be adopted in 2015, will have the potential to ensure the survival of the most vulnerable including women and children, and promote access to sustainable growth for all. Significant progress has been made during these two weeks. However, divergences persist and they should be dealt with in a constructive manner to achieve our mandate under the decision 1/CP17. For this, we need to move forward to more focused mode of negotiations. Our group urges the negotiating text to be available by the end of the COP20. Further engagement of Parties is needed under Workstream 1 to anchor all the elements for defining the overall architecture of the 2015 agreement, which should cover: mitigation, consistent with limiting warming to 1.5??C; enhanced action on adaptation; loss and damage; finance; technology; capacity building; transparency of actions and support. Co-chairs we reiterate that the 2015 agreement should be based on science and equity. Workstream 2 calls for urgency and concrete actions starting in 2014. We call for rapidly enhanced mitigation actions under the leadership of developed countries. Together with this, ambition by developing countries should be triggered by appropriate means of implementation. Co-chairs, we thank you for your leadership and job well done. We look forward to your final note, reflecting the progress achieved to date. This will be valuable for laying a solid foundation for further progress of ADP. We also congratulate the new co-chairs and assure them of our full support in thei\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-chair, PNG has the honor to speak on behalf of the 52 countries of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, of which the following have endorsed this statement. Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from the Republic of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chair, at the outset let me express our appreciation for your dedication as co-chairs. You have set the bar high, thankfully, and we are on solid ground for future work. Mr. Co-chair, the agreement to be reached by 2015 should be applicable to all Parties, be Party driven, be underpinned by the best science, and be based on the principles of the Convention. Further, it should be adequately informed by the work of other bodies under the Convention and include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by a broad variety of financing sources, with a leading role by developed country Parties. Mr. Co-chair, on the pre-2020 ambition track we again call for developed country Parties to assume leadership by increasing and enhancing their greenhouse gas reduction commitments, as required by the Convention. Developing country Parties, in particular rainforest nations, are prepared to contribute significantly to the fight against climate change. Mr. Co-chair, REDD+ has the potential to contribute significantly to the mitigation gap that all of humanity must achieve. To make this happen, new and additional financial and technical support for the implementation of REDD+ activities should be provided by developed country Parties so that REDD+ countries can voluntarily and meaningfully contribute to the emission reductions demanded by the latest science. Mr. Co-chair, on the way forward to Warsaw we appreciate the value of the open and frank exchange of views among Parties under the round-table format. Furthermore, we feel that it will allow Parties under the new co-chairs to undertake a more focused mode of work under a Contact Group format as of the next meeting. Mr. Co-chair, we must start to engage in direct negotiations as soon as possible. The 2015 deadline for the envisaged legally binding agreement must not be missed for any reason. Therefore, we support the call for at least one additional session to be held in 2014. Finally Mr. Co-Chair, let me assure you that the Coalition is ready and keen to continue working and engaging with all Parties in this process so that a new and ambitious, global climate change agreement is established by 2015. Thank you Mr. Co-chair\"',\n",
              "       '\"Pakistan has the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji on behalf of G77 & China. As we conclude our work here in Bonn and move towards COP-19 in Warsaw, we would like to share our perspectives on the ongoing work of the ADP and how we perceive it should progress in the coming 2 years. First and foremost, allow us to extend our gratitude to you Co-Chairs for your wise leadership of this process so far. Your perceptive stewardship of the ADP has enabled it to start on a good and positive note. Through your inclusive and transparent consultations and an open-ended informal organization of work, you have enabled the Parties to have a better understanding of each others positions. You guided the process when mutual confidence and understanding were needed and you listened to what the Parties wanted, even when we sometimes disagreed with you. We appreciate your efforts and your inclusivity. We hope the spirit of openness, transparency, inclusivity, fairness and party-driven approach that you have fostered in this group would abide in the coming two years. We also take this opportunity to welcome our new co-Chairs and we look forward to working with them. Mr. Co-Chairs, the group of like-minded developing countries has engaged in a spirit of urgency and .solid?rity in the work of the ADP. Our engagement is premised on enabling enhanced action on the implementation of the Convention. This is our mandate in the ADP. The developing countries are doing their part. We are doing so even as we bear the disproportionate burden of the impacts of climate change and continue to struggle with the challenges. of poverty eradication and achieving sustainable development. We therefore call on others to also do their part in fully implementing their commitments under the Convention, particularly developed countries who have long been expected to take the lead in this effort due to their historical responsibi lity and their capabilities. We hope that this expectation wi ll finally be realized as a result of our work here in the ADP. Secondly, even as we confront the unprecedented urgency of the challenge of climate change, we are equally conscious that we did not initiate this new process to renegotiate, replace, rewrite or restructure the Convention or to reinterpret its principles, provisions and structure. This understanding is fundamental to our group and we would challenge any effort that seeks to undermine the Convention or its principles and provisions. The mandate of the ADP is to enhance the implementation of the Convention not to reinterpret it. Needless to add, the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities are bedrock of our work and must be fully respected in he process as well as the outcome of the work under the ADP. Thirdly, as we move into COP-19 and beyond, we must now seek to focus our work on the Convention s four pillars for enhanced action, i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and the two other elements that we have all agreed to, i.e. capacity building and transparency of action and support, which are also related to the four main pillars. It is also time that we move into a more structured and formal organization of work bui lt around these pillars as integral and interlinked components of the final outcome of the ADP. We hope the incoming Co-Chairs will present us with a work programme on these lines. Fourthly, we would need to continue to ensure that there is balance in our work - balance between the two workstreams and in particular the elements within. them. While the timeframe for our action under the two workstreams may be different, the template of our action is common. This template must be based on the four Convention pillars of mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology transfer. We must ensure balance among them in both the workstreams. Fifth, developed countries must demonstrate their lead in enhancing their ambition in both the pre as well as post-2020 periods and not just in mitigation alone. Ambition must be enhanced in the provision of finance and technology to developing countries which is crucial for them to do more. Together with other developing countries from AOSIS, LDCs, and African Group, we call on the developed countries to increase their pre-2020 mitigation ambition by 2014 to at least 40 below 1990 levels. Developed Countries must also take the lead in modifying longer-term trends in their anthropogenic emissions by adopting more sustainable lifestyles and hence providing useful experiences in sustainable development for developing countries. Sixth, talking of mitigation, it is extremely important that we stick to the letter and spirit of the Convention. We have heard various proposals and models on burden-sharing. We are apprehensive of these proposals because they obfuscate differentiated responsibilities, and emphasize only common responsibilities. This goes against the interests of developing countries and also violates the grain of the Convention. Seventh, we remain cautious regarding many proposals on mitigation in the pre-2020 period. Such selective Sectoral activities must not have the effect of imposing additional burdens on developing countries. Activities and initiatives such as on HFCs or energy must be under the Convention ~nd fully respect Convention principles. The intense sensitivities of developing countries on the issue of agriculture, on which millions of poor farmers depend for their subsistence and livelihood, must be respected. Mr. Co-Chairs, we remain concerned with the lack of political will to meaningfully operationalize the instruments we have created on finance and technology. We cannot let them be empty shells. The output of these institutions will be a key basis of our actions in the post-2020 period and as such they must live up to the high expectations we have of them. A clear roadmap for developed countries to fulfill their financial support in the period of 2013 to 2020 in order to meet the goal of providing $100 billion dollars per year by 2020 and address barriers to technology transfer including IPRs must form part of our discussions under ADP Workstream II. Finally Mr. Co-Chair, we would like to underline the importance the group attaches to continued and enhanced work on Adaptation under the Convention as a result of the work of the ADP in both workstreams. The developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change which increases our adaptation costs and creates more challenges to our sustainable development. As such, we strongly support the proposal for a technical paper by the Secretariat on Adaptation. Mr. Co-Chairs, the group of like-minded developing countries will continue to engage proactively and ??positively with this process. You and your successors can count on our support to craft a truly ambitious, comprehensive, fair and equitable multilateral response to climate change under the Durban Platform. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-presidents, Ecuador has the honor of carrying out this intervention on behalf of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ALBA. Let us - partner and endorse, the statement made by Fiji on behalf of G77 + China and Pakistan on behalf of the Group of Developing Countries with LMDC thinking. We would like to acknowledge that although the work under the Ad Hoc Group on the Durban Platform is in process, there is still much to do and we must do it in a more efficient and concrete way than we have done so far. In a more formal and structured way, including the creation of a contact group. We should thank you as co-chairs for making the best attempt to lead this process in a wise, transparent and inclusive way that has allowed us to have a better understanding of the discussions, and it is precisely this understanding that we want to share with you today. ALBA enthusiastically appreciates the election of Venezuela through Miss Di Carlo as Rapporteur of the ADP Co-presidents, It is our duty as active participants in this multilateral process, to share with concerns and considerations for the future of our work. We must emphasize that work should be concentrated in light of the Convention and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. There can be no case in which we forget that the improved implementation of the Convention is based on something as simple as fulfilling the existing commitments ALREADY contemplated in this document. We, as developing countries, do this, and unfortunately we feel that we carry a disproportionate weight due to the lack of leadership of developed countries. We have hoped and insisted that this leadership be reflected, that the difference in capabilities be translated into actions that correspond to this situation and to these commitments. We are aware that ADP represents a new process. But an instrument, agreement or protocol with legal force under the Convention cannot rewrite it. We must close the gap, YES. But we must recognize that there are several gaps, not just one mitigation gap. There are financing gaps, adaptation gaps, technology development and transfer gaps, capacity development, and means of implementation. ALL of these are GAPS and I have not had any workshops or round tables that suggest closing them or treating them frankly. Finally, on the issue of Equity, we have all recognized that Equity must be a central element of the 2015 result, but we are not exploring the fact that we do not understand equity in the same way. Some think that equity means treating everyone as equal, regardless of their circumstances or precedents and across generations. This is NOT fairness between co-chairs and is not a concept that can be sustained or will stand the test of time. Equity must consider the circumstances of the Parties, their situations and realities, their capacities and responsibilities, the intergenerational effects and THE PRINCIPLES AND PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION. THAT ..... that is equity and it is an element that must be considered in the work of BOTH work routes and that must be reflected in the work we do under this regime before 2020 and after 2020 alike. We will not be able to work from a technical point of view only. The technical is subject to the guidance and political will of the parties, in good faith and the desire to work. Our work will be irrelevant if we do not reflect what the world expects of us, if we do not allow ourselves to establish the financial, technological, and technical instruments that make it possible to operationalize the commitments of the Convention. Without political will, willingness to cooperate and move forward, we will again be very disappointed. For both Mr. President, it is our interest to clearly state that significant progress at COP 19 depends on 3 critical elements: Completion of the ratification process of the amendment to the Kyoto Protocol - Establishment of ranges of mitigation objectives for countries Annex 1 - Specification of sources and objectives of financing for 2012, 2015 and thereafter. With these questions we depart from Bonn and we hope that the true political will to face Climate Change will be demonstrated to meet the demand of our peoples. Ladies and Gentlemen, without a doubt, the political will for ALBA s constructive work is guaranteed. Thank you, co-chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"We would like to stress the success from all parties in delivering on the CP 17 and CP 18 mandate for the organization of work under ADP in an informal, open, constructive and inclusive engagement, operationalized though. the roundtables and workshops. We celebrate that we were able to progress in the substance of our discussions in such a positive environment, and that we stood by the consensus reached in Doha to engage in a more focused and substantive work. AILAC would like to insist in the importance of standing by our agenda, reached as a balanced and delicate compromise between all parties. This agenda.should continue to lead our work through the following sessions of the ADP, be it in potential additional sessions in this semester or directly at COP 19 in Warsaw and beyond. We believe that we should continue to engage in this positive environment and we therefore would call for suspending the current session. A steady and swift transition for the incoming co-Chairs will secure as well the required continuity of our work, which is fundamental for a successful outcome under both workstreams. Meaningful progress under both workstreams is essential. Given that the 2015 agreement is applicable to all parties, AILAC welcomes the growing willingness of all parties to contribute through action towards achieving the ultimate goal of the Convention. AILAC believes there needs to be an adequate balance between the ability of the 2015 agreement to secure universal participation, considering national circumstances, while delivering environmental integrity according to science. In this regard, the 2015 agreement needs to be tailored not to accommodate specific parties, but to secure the achievement of the 2C goal. Warsaw is a fundamental milestone that should capture concrete progress of our focused work. A Warsaw decision should outline the substance and elements that will structure the 2015 agreement. This outline should enable us to timely deliver a draft text for the agreement as provided in the Doha decision, in May 2015. Elements of this outline should include in our view: 1. Common rules based system for accounting and MRV to ensure comparability of efforts and environmental integrity in the context of CBDRRC. A system for nationally determined contributions towards the global goal, including mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation in the context of climate action, Action on adaptation is at the core of the 2015 agreement, and shall be considered in a balanced manner. We need to build upon the current institutions under the Convention, but also go beyond the status-quo by giving adaptation a space in the agreement that is equally important as the space for mitigation. The new agreement should provide for funding and incentives that operationalize not only planning for increased resil ience but for actual implementation of adaptation actions. The less we mitigate, the less able we are to adapt. The less we adapt, the less we are able to mitigate. The linkage is evident. Science tells us, that if mitigation efforts are not sufficient to guarantee environmental integrity, we will be facing a situation where adaptation will not only be more costly, but also hardly possible. Some of our countries are already suffering irreversible impacts that threaten our livelihoods and opportunities for sustainable development. In this context, AILAC believes that loss and damage will need to be addressed in the new 2015 agreement. Finance, technology transfer and capacity building are necessary to enable all parties to implement adaptation and mitigation action on the ground, a necessity to make climate action a reality. Means of implementation cannot be discussed in a vacuum, but in a focused and concrete manner that relates to action and understanding the particularities of what is required in order to move from planning to implementing and achieving successful results in adaptation and mitigation. Innovative work on addressing these issues, needs to be launched now and develop as promptly and extensively as the undergoing development of mitigation efforts. A process for timely ex-ante review, that effectively allows parties to deliver their highest possible effort and do their fair share considering equity and science, to ensure both climate justice and environmental integrity of our response to climate change. The expected outcome of such a process would be to allow parties to find the appropriate level of effort through adequate incentives and windows of opportunity. Peers, scientific experts, and civil society should be able to play a role in such a process. A dynamic and iterative assessment mechanism, applicable to all parties, that allows us to adjust our commitments regularly and to enhance ambition towards the 22C goal, in accordance with our differentiated capabilities and responsibilities; If we are to translate our agreements into positive and real impacts in the implementation of the Convention and the achievement of its ultimate objective, we need to ensure that we all deliver on what we will commit to. Hence, a robust and effective compliance mechanism must be adequately designed and built in the 2015 agreement. This mechanism should include both incentives and sanctions as tools for accountability. Work under this workstream is a priority towards closing the mitigation ambition gap pre-2020. Inputs we consider catalytic for increased ambition pre-2020 have been put forward by parties and expert bodies. We should start building upon them. Energy was a good starting point as a sector that has a high mitigation potential and also represents a good opportunity for low carbon development with many significant co benefits. We look forward to ideas from parties on ways to engage in other equally relevant sectors. Further work needs to be done on providing spaces for existing UNFCCC bodies and institutions to contribute in creating an adequate environment for all parties to enhance their efforts pre 2020, including new pledges, and moving to the upper end of the existing ones. We also need to make WS2 a useful tool for all parties to prepare domestically and consider together operational ways to lift barriers to increasing ambition, including the pressing need for developed country parties to take the lead ratchet up their mitigation and support pledges, as well as developing country parties that have not yet voluntarily put forward their contributions do so. This is the only way we see forward, if we are-to timely close the mitigation ambition gap. There have been proposals for Ministerial engagement on WS2 in Warsaw, which would help us build the necessary political momentum to increase ambition and to reach decisions at COP 19 and COP 20 that capture pre 2020 ambition.\"',\n",
              "       '\"thanks the Co-Chairs for excellent work: guided wisely the work under the ADP, keeping us on our toes, and always in good humour. EIG believes we have made some progess at this session - we have furthered common ground and a better understanding on the areas we still need to engage on as the next steps. Indeed, further progress is urgently needed to adopt in 2015 an agreement for post-2020 and to increase ambition before 2020. And, Mr. Co-Chairs, in order to allow us to progress efficiently, we would strongly benefit from a progress report from you in which, under your authority, you summarize our discussions and the perceived common ground. The increasingly focused discussions in Round Tables and Workshop have helped to advance our understanding of important concepts and possible elements of the future regime. Mr. Chairmen, we all will benefit for further interaction in this nonnegotiating setting to further develop and deepen common ground on concepts. But Warsaw may well be the moment to move at the same time, i.e, in parallel to continuing common thinking in roundtable and workshop format, also into a more formal mode in order to capture in a decision the progress achieved so far and outline the next steps that we have to take. Mr. Co-chairs, on WS1: a decision in Warsaw is needed expanding our common understanding on the core elements of the 2015 Agreement, including that each Party will determine a quantifiable mitigation commitment, including targets or actions, as a fair contribution to the 2 objective; on the willingness and need to support this national determination through international guidance and discussion on fair differentiation and equity; on the modalities of the mitigation commitments, including the underlying rules and the needed ex-ante clarity; on the modalities of the process and the timing of determining and anchoring commitments; and on the elements of the agreement including time frame and structure. Thus, two steps are needed in Warsaw to allow us to progress: agreeing on what elements will have to be further developed and agreeing to initiate concrete work on these elements. In Warsaw, we will also have to further deepen our understanding on the elements of the 2015 Agreement to empower Parties in their adaptation efforts. And, we will have to progress in our understanding how the 2015 Agreement will catalyze means of implementation, including by increasing effectivity to address finance, technology and capacity needs. Mr. Co-Chairs, on WS2: Warsaw will be the moment for those Parties who have not yet submitted pledges to do so. In addition, we should continue and further deepen our common analysis of the mitigation potential. This will require an even more technical exchange. And this will create the good basis for a ministerial dialogue on increasing mitigation ambition prior to 2020. And, we will have to develop a better common understanding how initiatives outside of the UNFCCC can contribute to an increase in ambition. We should stimulate and support such initiatives, such as reforming fossil fuel subsidy policies. We should develop a good understanding of how these initiative reduce emissions, and we should acknowledge them as efforts to increase ambition. Mr. Co-chairs, you have given us a lot. Your wisdom, your commitment, your stimulation, your humour and your solution oriented, non-ideological, pragmatic and at the same time ambitious and visionary approach has helped us to so successfully advance in the first phases of ADP. With you, we have achieved more than many thought possible. But let us not only thank you with nice words, but by building on what you have helped us achieve so far and by delivering by 2015 an effective, fair, robust, and at the same time future proof and dynamic legally binding instrument to hold global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. Thank you \"',\n",

Co-Chairs, first we would like to extend our message of congratulations on your selection as the new Co-Chairs of the ADP. We would like to pledge our commitment to supporting you achieve the objectives of the Convention and the ADP at this critical time. We thanks the Polish Government and its people for the wonderful hospitality, facilitation and arrangements made to make this conference a success. We also like to thank the secretariat for their support. Co-Chairs, let me reiterate the inclusiveness of the Durban agreement and call for our approach to be balanced as we move forward. Particularly, we would like to support a balanced approach to workstream I and II. In our view, agreements reached under workstream II provides confidence and trust building measures for workstream 1. The Africa Group recognizes the need to start engaging more robustly, as we have a deadline for December 4014 for elements of the draft negotiating text. We also need to build our technical understanding on very important issues such the Global Goal for Adaptation, as well as the science and equity considerations in the 2015 Agreement We call for adaptation to be central to the agreement, with clear commitments for Annex II Parties towards adaptation, reflected in an Adaptation Goal. We support the Co-Chairs proposal for Parties to start engaging with each other, and the Africa Group submit that there 5 areas of negotiation that can help us in structuring the negotiation. First, General Commitments, based on the temperature goal to define the required global action. Second, specific commitments, differentiated for Parties covering mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology. Third, transparency and accountability provisions, building on Bali Action Plan and KP mechanisms. Fourth, defining of the role of operationa1 mechanisrns already established under the Convention. Fifth, matching of science to the country driven approach of pledges in Warsaw; we must take decisions that concretise elements that have been agreed, so as to facilitate implementation of climate action pre 2020. As a Group we are cautious about initiatives mat take attention away from Annex I raising their ambition pre 2020, by emphasizing processes for post 2021. Commitments by proponents of international cooperative initiatives need clear rules, finance provisions and recognition of the objective of the Convention. The need for an adequacy discussion prior to inscription of commitments, with such a discussion including mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. We also look forward to supporting you and engaging on some of the outputs currently on the table such as the Adaptation Technical Paper and the review of operational mechanisms and institutions under the Convention. Co-Chairs, I thank you.\"',\n",

We\\'d like to associate ourselves to the statement delivered by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. General approach to our work on ADP: First, AILAC s spirit In these negotiations is to build bridges within the variety of realities, capacities and responsibilities among different groups and countries. We have the willingness to act and remain at your disposal for Ideas, available to enhance our ambition and to lead with example; Second, In this spirit, we believe the purpose of the ADP should be focused in enhancing action for achieving the 1.5-2C global goal, that is to say to fulfill the ultimate objective of the Convention; Third, we agree that our work is not in a vacuum, but is oriented by all the work carried on under the Convention, previous decisions, and directed to its ultimate goal with guidance of the Convention s principles; Fourth, we all have something to contribute to this end. AILAC is and will continue Its efforts to contribute. We are ready to dive deeper into defining concrete elements of the basis of the 2015 agreement, in particular on adaptation, finance and transparency of action and support; Fifth. Thus far, the aggregate efforts have proven insufficient, with the impacts of inactions affecting all parties broadly; in this context, the work under both ADP workstreams call for urgency; Sixth. In terms of process, we trust that you will guide us wisely, and facilitate swiftly our work towards focused and deeper discussions, to allow us to deliver here in Warsaw, on the basic roadmap that will guide our work throughout 2014-2015. Our achievements here in Warsaw shall lay the foundations for success in Lima, and define the outline that will allow us to start working on text immediately in 2014. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"The Plurinational State of Bolivia has the honor of carrying out this intervention on behalf of the following countries that constitute the Bolivarian Peoples Alliance ALBA). Firstly, we associate this intervention with that made by the Distinguished delegate of Fiji, in his capacity as President of the Group of 77 and China and by Venezuela on behalf of the Group of like-minded countries. We want to express our solidarity with the people of the Philippines for the tragedy they have suffered. Mr. President. The responsibility of the Durban Platform Working Group is fundamental to resolve the urgent need to provide solutions to the climate crisis with a Work Program applicable before 2020 and a binding legal instrument that comes into effect after 2020 that Understand all core topics in a comprehensive and balanced way. The instrument to be agreed in 2015 and put into effect from 2020 must fully respond to the principles and provisions of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. The very serious events that many peoples of the world are suffering due to the impacts of extreme events caused by climate change, as is the case of the Philippines, demand urgent and drastic solutions. It is not fair that the peoples that are not the cause of climate change pay so severely for its consequences. For this reason, we must express, Mr. President, that we are concerned that despite the worrisome prognoses of temperature increase, sea level rise and more frequent and serious occurrence of extreme events, developed countries are not taking the lead in the performance of mitigation actions. Mr. President, precisely in order to build agreements, it is urgently necessary to provide the necessary means of implementation and financial resources so that mitigation and adaptation actions can be carried out in developing countries and that developed countries significantly increase their ambitions to reduce emissions. Both the Work Program and the new legal instrument applicable after 2020 must be in full compliance with the Convention. A system cannot be implemented that standardizes the obligations to all parties as if they were all the same. The principle ? of common but differentiated responsibility establishes that we have different historical responsibilities in global warming ? and, consequently, it is up to developed countries to implement ambitious actions and commitments expressed in a quantified way. That it is not intended to transfer these responsibilities to the developing countries. The developed countries should take the lead in the realization of commitments of mitigation and the developing countries we must carry out mitigation actions within the framework of compliance with Article 4.7 of the Convention, that is, with full compliance with the provision of means of implementation. Adaptation is one of the central issues for developing countries; however, this issue has not received adequate and sufficient attention from: developed countries. The adaptation institutional framework must be strengthened and must have new and additional financing for its operation. On the other hand, adaptation plans of developing countries must be fully supported by financial means, capacity building and the transfer of necessary technology. Financing must be of a public nature. That it is not intended to convert the post 2020 legal instrument or the pre-2020 action program into opportunities for make climate change a lucrative business without effective solutions for the effects of climate change, replacing the obligation of developed countries to provide public resources with bank loans, carbon markets, disaster risk insurance, private investments, etc. Climate change is not a business opportunity, it is a risk that endangers humanity, the risks of life and of Mother Earth cannot be commercialized. The Climate Change Convention is not a market convention. Developed countries must provide a significant percentage of their PIS annually within the framework of their historical responsibility so that developing countries carry out adaptation and mitigation actions.

              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues. Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. AOSIS associates itself with the statement made by Fiji on behalf the Group of 77 and China, and the statements made by Nepal on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group and Swaziland on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs. At the outset, let me also welcome you to your first session as co-chairs of this important working group and thank you for the leadership you have already demonstrated. I assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work to close the emissions gap and work towards a 2015 agreement. The time we have to act is rapidly slipping away for.the members of our group. The latest lPCC review confirms that unless urgent and dramatic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, the opportunity to avoid catastrophic global warming in excess of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels could be irrevocably lost While the UNEP gap report reminds us that taking the action required remains entirely technically and economically feasible, but only if parties increase ambition and achieve real emissions reduction beyond current pledges. Co-Chairs, We have agreed to organize our discussions into two separate workstreams and it is important that both be allocated adequate time here in Warsaw. Both Workstreams must be driven by a sense of urgency, mindful that a failure to act decisively now will only require a more reactive and vastly more expensive response later. Failure to close the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap will have profound implications for the scale and natl.ire of obligations under the 2015 protocol. To that end, AOSIS has submitted a plan under ADP Workstream 2 that would complement negotiations on the 2015 agreement with a new, truly collaborative technical process focused squarely on assessing the most promising mitigation opportunities and identifying strategies to overcome the obstacles that have prevented their wider implementation. In fact, we have brought renewable energy experts from each of our member regions-the Caribbean, AIMS, and Pacific regions-to Warsaw, so they can share success stories about the exciting work that is happening in their countries Stories of our collective efforts and experiences, should inform the discussions. of the ADP ministerial meeting with a view to adopting a decision on a detailed action plan for 2014 under Workstream 2. We must have sufficient time allocated to Workstream 1 at the ministerial meeting and in the ADP negotiations to reach an ambitious outcome. We have been consulting extensively with parties and look forward to discussing the details of our proposal in the coming days. We will also continue to encourage Parties to raise the ambition of their 2020 pledges, or to come forward with new pledges for those who have not yet done so. Co-chairs, We must also make progress under Workstream 1 and continue to build on the foundation of the Convention, and all its principles and provisions. The fact that we are now negotiating a new protocol under the Convention does not relieve developed countries of their responsibility to take the lead in addressing climate change. There cannot be any backslide in the type, nature, or ambition of their mitigation commitments under the 2015 agreement. The outcome of the ADP Workstream 1 should be a legally binding Protocol under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties and adopted no later than 2015. The safety, viability and survival of our members demands that the agreement be based on science and therefore include a global goal of keeping global warming well below 1.5 degrees. The alarming impacts of climate change that are unfolding before our eyes are all the more tragic because so many solutions ate within reach. We thus called developed countries to fulfill their longstanding commitments to provide the finance and technology needed to address climate change and its unnecessary impacts once and for all. We also need an ambitious and balanced outcome in the other areas mandated in the Durban Platform adaptation, finance, technology transfer and development, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. Damages are real and happening now, as Super typhoon Haiyan so graphically illustrates. We urge all Parties to work with an increased sense of urgency this week and above all focus on doing our part to achieve an ambitious, comprehensive and meaningful outcome. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of BASIC. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. First and foremost, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on this new position as the Co-Chairs of the Durban Platform. We will assure you our full support and unreserved cooperation to make concrete progress in advancing the work of the Durban Platform. Mr. Co-Chairs, we welcome the decision achieved in Doha on advancing the Durban Platform, which reaffirms that the work of the Durban Platform shall be guided by the principles of the Convention. We also welcome the progress made at the two meetings in Bonn this year as well as the acknowledgement by Parties that the Durban Platform process is to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention in order to achieve its ultimate objective. The process and outcome of the Durban Platform shall be under the Convention and guided by its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The Durban Platform process is by no means to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure, or reinterpret the Convention or its principles, provisions and Annexes. We reiterate our belief that the work of the Durban Platform should not take place in a vacuum. Instead, it should be based on and must be built on the work of the Bali Road Map. The Warsaw Conference should be an implementation COP. The effective implementation of the Bali outcomes is paramount for trust building amongst Parties and a solid foundation for the success of the work on the Durban Platform. Mr. Co-Chairs, We would like to emphasize that the Convention itself has provided the structure and design of the 2015 agreement, which defines the differentiation between developed and developing countries. The 2015 agreement shall adhere to the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Articles 4 and 12 as well as the Annexes, which fully reflect the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The 2015 agreement should address all elements referred to in paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17 in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and should, in particular, give equal priority to adaptation and mitigation as well as means of implementation. In this regard, the negotiation on the 2015 agreement should adhere to an \\x1caction-orientated approach\\x1d, focusing on enhanced actions that need to be undertaken for the implementation of the Convention from 2020 in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change in accordance with their historical responsibilities and what is required by science, by undertaking ambitious quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and fulfilling commitments of providing finance and technology support to developing countries. We welcome the Brazilian submission on the Development of a reference methodology on historical responsibilities by the IPCC to guide domestic consultations for the ADP 2015 agreement, as a useful contribution to discussions on an equity-based approach. The enhanced mitigation and adaptation actions of developing countries should be enabled by the provision of adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed countries. We would like to further highlight the importance of effective implementation of Article 4.7 of the Convention, which is crucial for the 2015 agreement. We recognize that the roundtables and workshops have enabled Parties to enhance their understanding about each other\\x19s position. However, it is necessary for Parties to start focusing on enhanced action on all pillars, mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology of the Convention and drawing a clear picture on the organization of the work in the future. Therefore, we call for a more structured and formal mode of work. This balanced, structured, focused and formal mode of work should be established in Warsaw, which is the essential step towards capturing the progress and defining the content of the agreement. It is also important for the Warsaw Conference to encourage and support Parties to engage in domestic consultations and preparations in the context of the Durban Platform negotiations. We would like to further call on developed countries to do their homework particularly on their provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries in addition to their mitigation commitments. Mr. Co-Chairs, The pre-2020 ambition gaps exist not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation, finance, technology and capacity building as well as in equitable access to sustainable development. The low level of ambition of developed countries?? commitments on emission reduction and provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support remains a matter of grave concern. If the developed countries had committed to an emission reduction of 40% below their 1990 levels by 2020, the pre-2020 mitigation gap would not even have existed. We stress that the pre-2020 ambition must be addressed in a comprehensive manner primarily through the imp\"',\n",

Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from the Republic of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-Chair, at the outset, let me welcome you both in this new role and we are confident that under your able leadership we will be able to maintain the high bar you have set and produce an excellent result on the way to the new agreement. Mr. Co-Chair, the agreement to be reached by 2015 should be applicable to all Parties and be based on all the .principles of the Convention, including common but differentiated responsibilities, historical responsibility and equity. It should take into account the latest scientific information be adequately informed by the work of other bodies under the Convention and include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by a broad variety of financing sources, with a leading role by developed country Parties. Mr. Co-chair, on the pre-2020 ambition track we again call for developed country Parties to assume leadership by increasing and enhancing their greenhouse gas reduction commitments, as required by the Convention and consistent with the long term goal agreed since in Copenhagen. To demonstrate commitment, developing country Parties, in particular rainforest nations, are prepared to contribute significantly to the fight against climate change. Mr. Co-chair, REDD+ has the potential to significantly contribute to the global mitigation solution. To make this happen, new and additional financial and technical support for the implementation of REDD+ activities should be provided by developed country Parties, accompanied by a new governance architecture, so that REDD+ countries can assume a primary role in enhancement of the level of ambition. Mr. Co-chair, we appreciate the value of the open and frank exchange of views among Parties under the round-table format so far. At the same we must start to engage in direct negotiations as soon as possible so that a clear and ambitious roadmap up to the end of 2015 is defined here in Warsaw along the following lines. A focused work on the structure and specific aspects of the 2015 agreement should start here and continue up to the next session in March 2014. These considerations should be captured in a non-paper by the co-chairs, as usual practice, to be discussed in the June session in Bonn. Then, Parties should be given time to digest and reflect on the identified key elements of the 2015 agreement so that a negotiating text is made available before COP20. In Lima Parties should then agree on the timeline and milestones for finalization of the agreement by the end of 2015. Finally Mr. Co-Chair, let me assure you that our Coalition is ready and keen to continue working and engaging with all Parties in this process so that a new and ambitious, global climate change regime is established by 2015. Thank you Mr. Co-chair\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chair, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. Mr Co-Chair. First of all, the EIG congratulates you and your Co-Chair for your election. The EIG is very much looking forward to working with you. Mr Co-Chair. The ADP here in Warsaw must take a significant step towards the 2015 Agreement. Warsaw must provide a clear signal of all Parties to participate under the 2015 Agreement through appropriate mitigation commitments, which may include targets or actions. These commitments of all Parties must be based on the same legal form and on the same internationally agreed rules. It is such a rules-based system common to all Parties that will allow for comparability of efforts - with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities taken into account- that will provide the certainty to the Parties to act in a collective effort and, thus, that will allow for trust and ambition to prosper. We need a rules-based yet dynamic and flexible regime with the participation of all Parties reflecting the changing economic realities, national circumstances, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. With the same priority, we must address adaptation under the 2015 Agreement in a differentiated manner as required. The 2015 Agreement shall promote cooperation in adaptation in view to increase adaptive capacity and resilience of all Parties in the context of sustainable development. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement must be underpinned by adequate means of implementation, an effective financial mechanism and contributions from all developed Parties and those in a position to do so, according to their responsibilities, capacities and equity. Here in Warsaw we must provide a clear signal that all Parties are preparing for their efforts in mitigation, adaptation and mobilization of means of implementation post-2020. It is necessary for this workstream of the ADP work in a more focused way during 2014 that will allow for the drafting of text of the new instrument, as decided at COP 18. Therefore, the EIG advocates the adoption of a Decision, at this COP with the elements, structure and scope of the new agreement. Mr Co-Chair. Pre-2020 Mitigation Ambition is another urgent workstream under the ADP. The current global mitigation ambition falls short from the recommendations by science to hold global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius - we have to strengthen international cooperation on immediate additional actions. Here in Warsaw we must set up focused and technical work under the ADP workstream 2 examining concrete options to increase ambition. And we must provide for a platform to foster initiatives additional to the current mitigation commitments. Finally, the UNFCCC must send a clear invitation to the Montreal Protocol for phasing down the highly climate relevant HFCs. Mr Co-Chair, It is crucial that the urgent issue of pre-2020 ambition is considered at the high-level. The EIG is looking forward to working with you towards a successful Ministerial dialogue under the ADP here in Warsaw on the issue of pre-2020 ambition as well as the 2015 Agreement. Thank you, Mr Co-Chair.\"',\n",
              "       '\"This is a statement on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, The EU would like to welcome the new co-Chairs. They have our full trust and we are confident that they will constructively take forward the excellent work of their predecessors. The ADP achieved good progress in its sessions in Bonn this year. However, there is still much left to do, little time in which to do it and the imperatives for action could not be stronger. The recent IPCC Working Group 1 report gives us three clear messages: i) climate change is happening; ii) humans are the cause of climate change; iii) and we need to act urgently and effectively if we are to avoid its worst effects. In our discussions in Workstream 1 it is essential that we get deeper into the substance of the elements that Parties want to see included in the 2015 Agreement. These are: adaptation, means of implementation, transparency of action and support as well as mitigation. All these aspects need to be reflected in a fair and ambitious legally binding 2015 agreement. The agreement must be applicable to all Parties, to be adopted at COP21 as agreed and preferably take the form of a Protocol under the Convention. That Agreement must be ambitious enough to keep us on track for below 2?C, catalyse adaptation action and lead us towards a climate resilient world. Parties have made submissions that provide us with useful input towards meeting those objectives that we will need to consider carefully in the coming days. As well as making progress on the substantive elements of the 2015 Agreement, Warsaw must also set out the timeline and process to deliver the Agreement in Paris. The EU and other Parties have proposed ideas for a process to deliver ambitious mitigation commitments in the 2015 Agreement. In particular there has been significant interest in a so-called hybrid approach that combines nationally proposed mitigation commitments with an international process to ensure those commitments are fair and ambitious, and enough to keep us on track for below 2?C. Warsaw needs to consider carefully the ideas presented by Parties. We also need to reach agreement here on the way forward including a timeline to prepare the proposed commitments in 2014. But it is clear that Parties need to also consider a process for how the other essential elements of the 2015 Agreement will be elaborated during 2014. In particular on adaptation, means of implementation and the set of rules, including an accounting framework. All Parties have agreed to close the mitigation ambition gap before 2020. That was an essential element of the agreement reached in Durban. As such the work of Workstream 2 must result in an outcome here which takes forward specific options that consequently lead to tangible results. More particularly, in Warsaw me must agree on a process for considering new and enhanced pre-2020 mitigation pledges and accelerate the full implementation of existing pledges. A pledge is just that - a pledge. There must be no backtracking. In addition we must also identify areas of high mitigation potential in which concrete actions can be taken through voluntary international initiatives, and elaborate the role of the UNFCCC in facilitating, scaling up and supporting such initiativ\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. The Umbrella Group has been consistent and clear about what the ADP must deliver a 2015 agreement that is meaningfully applicable to all Parties - establishing a common playing field for all countries to commit to post-2020 action - and an examination of practical options to raise global pre-2020 ambition. To reach our goal we need to move away from the paradigms of the past, and look at how we can create conditions which drive cooperation, confidence and action, all with an appreciation of countries national circumstances, aspirations and capabilities. Science tells us that it is urgent, and we need to enhance the global effort. Co-Chairs, We are encouraged by the constructive discussions this year on the substance of the agreement. They have been helped by the trust Parties have shown in the ability of the previous co-chairs to fairly and productively guide our discussions. We are sure Parties will invest the same confidence in the leadership of our current co-chairs. Much productive work has been carried out in the ADP this year. Through roundtables and workshops in workstream 1, Parties have begun to build an understanding of key elements of the 2015 agreement, including the importance to countries of nationally determined commitments. The need for clear ex-ante and ex-post transparency framework. The need to consider how the 2015 agreement will best secure ambition, including through an up-front consultative process. And the need for a 2015 package that strikes a balance between identifying mitigation as our first line of defence, recognising the reality of the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change now, and means of implementation to support effective mitigation and adaptation outcomes. We need to take this work forward by using Warsaw to build momentum toward an effective 2015 agreement in Paris in which all countries contribute to the best of their abilities. We should continue mapping out the functional elements that will be part of a 2015 instrument and broader package. We will need to lay the groundwork for these elements to be brought together into a single, concise, clear negotiating text for next year. At the same time, all countries should at home begin to consider the contribution they will make to global post-2020 action. We need to think further about how proposed commitments can be clearly defined through accompanying up-front information, allowing everyone to understand what countries propose to do. And we should consider how best to progress work on a transparency framework that supports commitments and gives Parties confidence in each others actions. In workstream 2, we have engaged constructively in conversations on initiatives to help enhance pre-2020 mitigation ambition, and heard many examples of action that is taking place. This includes cooperative actions outside of the UNFCCC to cut emissions - with the Umbrella Group supporting the Montreal Protocol to address the issue of envisaged phase down of HFCs. And every effort counts. To this end, we encourage countries that have not yet made a 2020 pledge including 20 of the top 50 emitters to do so. Co-Chairs, Alongside technical work in the ADP, we need to provide space for conversations to move forward on political aspects of our work. The planned High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on the Durban Platform is a valuable opportunity for these conversations to take place and help build the political will for a 2015 deal and enhanced action pre-2020. The UN Secretary General s summit next September will be a key moment in the political timeline to Paris. We welcome you and entrust you to carry forward the work of the ADP. We look forward to a productive session here in Warsaw under your able stewardship. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, As we begin more focused work the ADP we are faced with the grim impacts of climate change on the ground. During the last three days, Super Typhoon Haiyan, cut a swath of devastation across North Palau and the Central Philippines, leaving a trail of death and widespread destruction. This is the 6th typhoon to hit Palau in the last two years, compared with just two in the preceding 30 years. Both the Philippines and Palau are now struggling desperately to recover from this super typhoon and Vietnam is even now bracing for this storm to make landfall. These horrific events and the tragic loss of lives and property demand that we approach the negotiations on the 2015 agreement with heightened responsibility and renewed urgency. Mr. Co-Chairs, As we have stated previously The Group of 77 and China strongly believe that the decisions of Durban and Doha provide the mandate for the work of the ADP. In work-stream one including inter alia on Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology Development and Transfer, Transparency of Actions and Support, and Capacity Building. On work-stream two, on a work plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to identify and to explore options for a range of actions that can close the ambition gap with a view to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts by all Parties. We also underline the high priority that the Group attaches to enhancing actions on adaptation and means of implementation in the work of the ADP. The Group of 77 and China also reiterate that the effective implementation of the Bali Road Map will lay a solid foundation for the success of the work of the Durban Platform. The Group is prepared to engage with you and with our Annex I partners to progress our work in a more balanced, focused, formal and Party-driven mode here in Warsaw, focusing on the enhanced actions under the elements of Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology Development and Transfer, Transparency of Actions and Support, and Capacity Building and reiterates the need to maintain a balance, both in terms of content and progress of the work in both workstreams, and stresses that all elements of post-2020 outcome should have the same legal nature. To this end, the Group of 77 and China believes that the six points identified as the Group s position on ADP at the April session remain relevant and bear repeating; i. The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles, and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; ii. The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; iv. The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. In the work of the ADP under work-stream 2, as we have also stated previously, developed countries must demonstrate clear and unconditional leadership in mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology development and transfer. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China expects that the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol enter into force as soon as possible. It is paramount that the ambition mechanism launched in Doha effectively results in the increase of the ambition of Annex I Parties quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments for the second commitment period. We therefore urge all Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to go through the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible, and to revisit and significantly increase their quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments by 2014. It is crucial that we should ensure the operationalization and implementation of the 2014 Revisit Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol in Warsaw. We likewise urge non-KP Annex I Parties to increase their mitigation ambition in a comparable manner within the same timeframe. All Annex I Parties must undertake additional verifiable actions under the Kyoto Protocol, as well as under the Convention with a view to close the ambition gap by 2020. The enhanced commitments from the Annex I Parties in 2014 for the post-2020 period should be the first step, since this would directly impact the level of ambition in workstream 1 for the post-2020 period. The members of Group of 77 and China have made greater contributions on combating climate change than those of developed countries during the pre-2020 period. We urge developed country Parties to fulfill and enhance their commitments on the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries, which is fundamental for developing countries to implement our actions on adaptation and mitigation. Mr. Co-Chairs, As we have repeatedly been reminded by the Presidency of the COP, time is not on our side. We fully concur. Even as I speak, 600,000 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas of Vietnam in response to the same typhoon, further underscoring the importance of financing and implementing adaptation measures. Ultimately, the Group is of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, and should further strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention in order to achieve its ultimate objective. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, Honorable Ministers, Excellencies and Colleagues, Good Afternoon. On behalf of AOSIS, we would like to thank you both for your work. While we think that there are far too many issues that were left undecided by our work here in Warsaw on ADP, we are heartened by the progress on Workstream 2. We believe that paragraph 5 of this decision provides a real opportunity to unlock mitigation opportunities that will help get us back on track to limit warming to well below 1.5 degrees. It is crucial that we go home, do our homework, and bring options for enhanced mitigation efforts for decisive action by Ministers at key political moments in this coming year.\"',\n",
              "       '\"LMDC Opening Statement for ADP - COP 19. Mr. Co-Chairs. I make this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. We fully endorse the statement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. I take the liberty of making some specific points on various aspects of the 2015 Outcome so that we will be able to engage constructively with the other Parties to take the discussions in the ADP forward. The 2015 Outcome for the post-2020 period should be guided by the Principles and Provisions of the Convention, on the basis of Equity and in accordance withCommon but Differentiated Responsibilities, since it is under the Convention. We recall Article 3.1 of the Convention where, inter alia, it is also incumbent that developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects. It is important that we build on the principles and provisions of the Convention by preserving and reinforcing various aspects of the Convention, where enhanced actions are required to meet the ultimate objective of the Convention. In addition, we see the need to make progress on enhanced action on all the elements identified in para 5 of decision 1. CP 17 of the Durban COP. We see progress in enhancing the implementation of the elements as a balanced and comprehensive one. By this, we mean that the progress should be on all the elements a.nd the progress should be symmetrical. We would like to underline that whatever legal form we adopt, all elements of the post-2020 outcome should have the same legal nature. We cannot have a situation where different elements in the so-called package are treated differently under any agreement. We also believe that the Annexes in the Convention are based on scientific assessments of historical responsibilities. To abolish the Annexes or to make them irrelevant would be to obfuscate the historical responsibilities of developed countries. This is clearly against the provisions of the Convention. Mitigation by developed countries must be central to the post-2020 period and the developed countries should, according to Article 3.1, take the lead through ambitious emission reductions undertaken domestically. There must be comparability of efforts among Annex I Parties with respect to their mitigation 1 commitments. Mitigation contributions should be determined nationally for Non-Annex I Parties. It is inevitable that there would be a variety in the nature of actions or contributions e.g. enhanced NAMAs) by Non-Annex I Parties. Consequently, actions of Non-Annex I Parties should be nationally determined. We have put in place ICA and IAR to review the QELROs of Annex I and the NAMAs of non-Annex I made for the post-2020 period. Much work has been done on the transparency regime and we need to use it to bring greater clarity to the process. Furthermore, in addition to differentiation) there must appropriate sequencing?tnterrns of mitigation under the Convention. Developed countries take the lead on mitigation as well as other areas) under the Convention. Developing countries may follow with enhanced actions to implement the Convention on the basis of support from developed countries according to Article 4.7. We do not see any role for a two-step process in the ex-ante process for review of efforts of developing countries. Any framework which seeks to determine for developing countries what they should contribute in any future regime goes against the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities based on historical responsibility. As Article 3.1 states, equity lies in developed countries taking the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof. Non-Annex I Parties cannot be on the same template as the Annex I Parties. Any enhancement of ambitions to meet any future mitigation gap, and even the current one, should be done in accordance with article 3.1 and the Annex I Parties should take the lead and meet it. Applicability to all doesn t mean uniformity in application. The ADP outcome as a multilateral instrument would be applicable to all Parties but that there can be differentiation in both its content and its application by Parties on the basis of the differentiation already established by the Convention between developed and developing countries. Articles 12.1 and 12.2 of the Convention deals with reporting obligations. We have had separate tracks on reporting and accounting rules as per the nature of the responsibility we have, as reflected in the two Annexes. It is not conceivable that the nervousness of the responsibility of Non-Annex I should be the same as Annex I. Common Accounting Rules cannot be for all Parties without any regard for the two Annexes and the nature of their reporting obligations. Common Accounting rules are for the Annex I parties, for both KP and non-KP Parties, As regards the timing of putting forward QELROs for Annex I and of contributions for non?Annex I for the post-2020 period, we need to keep in mind the ambition levels of the pre-2020 period and Work Stream 2. What we have agreed in Doha is to review commitments and enhance the 2 ambition of the Annex I parties under KP. We need to know as a first step by how much the ambition levels are bring increased. Consequently, we will call for the 2014 review on commitments being undertaken first by Annex before we move to the post-2020 period. If not, then there is a real danger of ambition level of the pre-2020 period being transferred to the post2020 period.  We recall Article 4.7 in the context of actions on mitigation. This means that the extent to which developing countries implement the Convention and enhance their actions depends on the extent to which developed countries fulfill their obligations under Art. 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. Enhanced action on mitigation will require enhanced action on means of implementation. We also need to respond to economic and social consequences of response measures as set out under the Bali Action Plan. Adaptation is a key priority for us. Art 4.4 defines the basis for international cooperation in this regard, under which Annex II Parties commit to support the costs in developing countries to address the adverse effects of climate change, including on loss and damage. However, adaptation has not rec.eived adequate attention as opposed to mitigation despite the large number of decisions by the COP on adaptation. This situation has to change and we need enhanced action. The Loss and Damage mechanism established in Doha must? be made operational. Adaptation institutions under the Convention must be strengthened and financed. Quantitative increases In the ability of adaptation financing institutions to deliver and support funding for adaptation in developing countries must be made. In this regard, the NAPs of all developing countries must be fully supported. We also need to enhance action on adaptation relating to economic diversification to build resilience as set out in the Bali Action Plan. The fulcrum of the balance In the Convention lies in Art 4.7, under which the extent-to which developing countries Implement their commitments under the Convention depends on the extent to which developed?counttres implement their commitments to provide finance and technology under Art 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. The financing obligation under the Convention is for Annex II Parties, not for their private sector. As such, public finance from developed countries must be the primary source of financing to developing countries under the Convention. Public financing could leverage private finance and other sources but should remain the primary vehicle. Financing requirements does not mean creating an enabling environment. The $100 billion to be provided by developed countries at Cancun is only the starting point for the post-2020 period and not the ending point. This needs to be scaled up to meet the necessary levels of the real financing needs of developing countries in the context of the actions that they need to undertake in order to cope with the adverse effects of global warming up to and beyond the 2C temperature goal. The Convention s financial mechanism must be made more robust, with new, additional, adequate and predictable funding going towards its operating entities such as the GCF. In this regard, Annex II parties must provide a clear roadmap for public climate financing from developed? countries with specific targets, timellnes, and sources. Any burden-sharing for the provision of climate finance, under the Convention, must be done-among developed countries. We also need to reinforce nonmarket approaches and mechanisms. We need as much transparency in the means of implementation as in clarifying mitigation pledges and commitments. We look at financing under the Convention as the commitment of Annex 11 only and not the role of South-South cooperation. South-South cooperation has evolved as a voluntary effort over time and completely differs from the obligatory and responsibility framework which motivates the North-South template. Another important aspect on which enhanced action is required in the context of technology development and transfer are removal of barriers, especially issues related to IPRs, and enhanced financial support for technology development and transfer for developing countries. Article 4.5 of the Convention is far from realising the potential for which it was inserted. Enhanced action should apply to both mitigation and adaptation related technologies. We call on specific windows for technology development and transfer in the Convention financial mechanism entities and funds e.g. GCF, GEF, AF, LDCF, SCCF, etc. Annex I Parties need to put in place the enabling environment in their own countries that will remove the barriers such as cost and IPRs) to technology development and transfer and enable them to effectively implement their technology development and transfer obligations to developing countries. Transparency of the provision of support will be a key element in the ADP outcome. Enhancements are needed with respect to the transparency regime for the provision of support to developing countries, including financing and technology\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, Excellences and distinguished delegates, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of LDCs. Our Group associates itself with the statements made by Fiji on behalf of G77 and China, by Swaziland on behalf of the Africa Group, and by Nauru on behalf of the AOSIS. First of all, I would like to congratulate both of you on your election as Co-chairs of the ADP. We believe that under your able leadership, ADP will deliver concrete outcomes here in Warsaw. I thank you and the Secretariat for the preparations made for this meeting. Thank you also for the two technical papers, the overview of institutions, mechanisms and arrangements under the Convention, as well as your scenario note. As you mentioned in your message, we fully agree with you that the ADP has laid a strong foundation and we are now ready to shift gears, moving on from developing and understanding the concepts to defining the content of the 2015 agreement and achieving concrete results on pre-2020 ambition. Co-Chairs, we have spent a considerable time sharing our views on the scope, structure and elements of the 2015 agreement. It is now time that we start building the process for the 2015 agreement by further clarifying the way forward. The time and the schedule we have for this is very tight. Co-Chairs, we reiterate that the outcomes of the ADP must be in line with the ultimate objective of the Convention and this can only be achieved through a collective and equitable sharing of efforts and universal participation. With the very survival of many of our nations at stake, only the highest level of commitment from all is acceptable. Only this will guarantee global climate action towards stabilization of the average global temperature to prevent dangerous climate change. Some Parties advocate their right to assess whether their contribution under the 2015 agreement is acceptable to them. However, we are concerned that the current proposals do not respect moral and legal obligations of these parties to respect the right of the most vulnerable countries to defend their survival.  We believe that a voluntary, non-binding pledge and review regime will not deliver what is required by science to address the climate change challenge and could lead towards a 4 ?C warming world while the scientific community has shown that the l.5?C goal is still technically and economically feasible. However, the frontiers of possibilities are closing faster. Co-Chairs, in this context, we have four suggestions for the way forward in Warsaw: Advance on concrete actions under both workstreams through formal sessions rather than general workshops and roundtables only. To this end, we suggest that we establish two contact groups- one for each workstream. Work on clear vision of timeline and deliverables needed to reach the global agreement at COP 21 and close the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap as soon as possible. This means that we should advance in all the fronts, including ensuring a decision to set up a clear process to clarify all Parties emissions reduction targets - and financial contributions under both workstreams. The new agreement should address mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity building in a balanced and effective manner.

              "       '\"Statement on behalf of the African Group of Negotiators AGN). By the Republic of the Sudan, at the Opening Plenary of Fouth Part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group Of Durban Platform on Enhance Action Bonn, Germany, 10-14 March 2014. Co-chairs, Allow me at the outset to express our appreciations to the Govemment of Germany for hosting meeting, and for the Conventions Secretariat for their excellent The African Group reiterates its views regarding the importance of maintaining the integrity of the ADP process within the UNFCCC framework, which is multilateral in nature, and rules-based. We enter tnis phase of our discussions to negotiate in good faith, and will work under your able guidance, towards outcome that will serve all our interests in a balanced maimer. Effective global cooperation is not an option for Africa, but a necessity as impacts of climate change continue to undermine our pursuit of sustainable development. Global action is urgent in addressing this serious challenge of climate change. Co-chairs, we take note of your scenario note, including proposals that you have put forward in respect of hope we organize our work for this session, as well as substantive elements that we as parties need to deliberate in the course of 2014. It is our view that we need a clear work plan for all sessions in this year for both workstreams. We conmend the work you have done to date as Co-chairs, we affirm our continued support to you in guiding us through this negotiation. Our expectations for 2014, as outlined in decision 1/CP.19, is nothing short of elements of the draft negotiating text for the 2015 Agreement, which would reflect the views expressed and negotiated by Parties. The various modalities which included open-ended consultations, briefings, workshops, and others, have been useful in distilling some important aspects of the elements of the negotiating text that need our attention. We see a role for a variety of modalities as different issues are at different stages of maturity, however recognising the an1ount of time available to us, as well as the centrality of Party ownership of negotiating text, we are of the view that this session would be an opportune time to work in a contact group format, such that Parties views can be formally recorded, and that we can capture emerging convergence on some issues. Co-chairs, On substantive elements of the scenario note, firstly the work on contributions envisaged in the Warsaw decision, our expectations tally with what you identified in the scenario note, we need to build understanding on what the contributions are, how they will be communicated, received and assessed. Our expectation is that by June we should be in a position to inform on our domestic preparatory processes, whilst adopting a decision to that effect in Lima. The second aspect of our substantive world which is elements of the draft negotiating text, our view is that paragraph 5 of decision l/CP .17 provides a sound basis for the definition of elements of the negotiating text, whilst acknowledging the work we have done to date under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol as an integral part of the 2015 Agreement. Our proposal is that we should create space for a discussion on the architecture of the 2015 Agreement, taking note of our proposal for an architecture that covers, general aggregate commitments, specific commitments, definition of the role of operational mechanisms and institutions established under the Convention, and lastly, transparency, accountability, compliance and review provisions, building on Bali Action Plan and KP mechanisms. Co-chairs, the ADP workstream 2 is the ultimate building block to demonstrate our resolve in tackling climate change in any significant manner under the 2015 Agreement. In Warsaw, we reaffirmed the importance of accelerating implementation of all Bali Actions Plan decisions, as well as increasing ambition both under the Convention and the pre-2020 ambition workplan. We also took note of the UN Secretary General Summit next September, and the Ministerial Dialogue next June and at COP 20, and it is important for us to understand how these processes will inform the negotiation process, as well as the work needed under the UNFCCC to support those processes. In this session, Co-chairs, you have organized the world around the renewable energy and energy efficiency sub-sectors. As much as we stand ready to engage during the following days specifically on these areas we stress the necessity of addressing two elements to further enhance our work. We have indicated our expectation of a clear organisation of work for the year, and we would like early engagement of our Group on topics for each session in order to ensure effective participation and ownership of the process. Co-chairs, if we are to achieve a significant and adequate increase in the level of global mitigation ambition in the near future, we have to go beyond identifying and exploring mitigation potentials in different economic sectors by elaborating a comprehensive and robust incentive framework allowing both developed and developing countries to harness those potentials. Therefore, Africa would request the preparation of a technical paper identifying the full range of incentives- types per thematic and geographical distribution, which would help in making concrete recommendations to the COP for its consideration. Co-chairs, The African Group stand ready during this session to enter into an open and transparent dialogue in a formal mode of work: that would move us toward achieving the mandate of ADP for this year, and bring us closer to an agreed elements of negotiation text for the 2015 agreement. I thank you\"',\n",
              "       '\"GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS: AILAC reiterates that in its view, the negotiations under the ADP should have as an outcome the definition of a new agreement that will be legally binding in nature. This legally binding agreement should aim at achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention, and be based on science. In this light, AILAC stresses that all the components of the legally binding agreement should be granted equal relevance and should have the same legal nature.  The link between climate change and development options should be clearly reflected on the legally binding agreement. Climate change is a direct threat to development. This threat is represented in the impacts that climate change has in all countries, and especially in those developing countries that are particularly vulnerable, which directly undermine the efforts to achieve sustainable development by inflicting incalculable losses in their economic, social and environmental structures and development trajectories, and undermining efforts to guarantee the wellRbeing of their populations. Thus, climate change is a threat to the equitable right to development, not because the need to limit emissions, but because its impacts limit development opportunities and undermines development gains. Poverty eradication efforts are therefore challenged.   In this context, the focus of the new legally binding agreement should be on options and actions that all countries can pursue in order to pursue sustainable development pathways compatible with climate protection. The \\x1cclimateRfriendly economy\\x1d is about addressing development needs while mitigating GHG emissions so as to avoid catastrophic climate change. The new legally binding agreement should set the conditions for a global economy of growth that is climate-sensitive: a \\x1cClimate Global Economy\\x1d. Achieving this outcome requires an inclusive, transparent, and partyRdriven process. Arriving at the required deep and structural transformation of world economy to a lowRcarbon, climate-resilient development paradigm requires that the UNFCCC process deliver ambitious evidenceR based results, with engaged participation by all Parties in the definition of the future agreement. However, Parties need to ensure that the final agreement has the necessary flexibility to take into account each country\\x19s specific and evolving circumstances, and thus avoiding the need for renegotiations in the future.  2014 is the pivotal year for the process, and Lima the key milestone. What we achieve R or not R in Lima will be decisive in defining the level of ambition, scope and nature of the new agreement. Therefore, there is an urgent need to make substantial progress during 2014 in the process of achieving a legally binding agreement by COP21 in Paris. A prerequisite for this is to arrive at functional draft text by COP20 in Lima.   During COP19, we failed both to agree to a clear timeline that would guide the work we are now starting in this session, and to define the specific elements that will be included in the agreement. It is fundamental that in the first session of 2014 we agree to the timeline, and that we define the specific elements of the agreement no later than the June session SBs 40, ADP 2R5). We trust, however, that Parties will understand the historic responsibility that we have and ensure that we do not get caught in fruitless, tactical discussions over \\x1cprocess\\x1d. STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE AGREEMENT: The COP mandated the ADP to further elaborate, beginning at this first session of the ADP in 2014, the elements for a draft negotiating text including the work on, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacityRbuilding and transparency of action and support. AILAC reiterates what was expressed in the previous submission put forward in August 2013, regarding the overall structure of the new legally binding agreement, which shall include at least the following elements: Preamble; Mitigation including REDD+; Adaptation and Loss and Damage; Means of Implementation; Transparency; Compliance. The next paragraphs develop some initial ideas on the content for each of these elements, without prejudice to the need to include additional elements and additional detail in the content of each element, as the boundaries of the new legally binding agreement are defined.  First, Preamble. The preamble needs to make a reference at least to the following basic aspects:  R The ultimate objective of the convention and the global goal to achieve it through the implementation of the new legally binding agreement; R The fundamental basis of the agreement on science; R The core characteristic of the agreement that refers to it being \\x1capplicable to all\\x1d; R The principles of the Convention as a basis and guiding framework for the new agreement, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, including historic responsibility and evolving respective capabilities; The recognition of the collective responsibility incumbent on all parties for both mitigation and adaptation, based on equity and sustainable development; Second, Mitigation including REDD+. The agreement must have a section on mitigation, which would address at least the following issues: A reference to the global mitigation goal that needs to be achieved through efforts by all parties according to the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. A reference to the mechanism to determine nationally determined contributions, which should take a legally binding form, to ensure the new agreement is actually applicable to all and will enhance ambition at the national level in every country party, and through this, at the global level with the aim of achieving the common goal; A reference to the basic information that needs to accompany the statement of commitment made by each country party, in order to make commitments comparable, and to ensure that their format allows for global aggregation in order to ensure environmental integrity in the achievement of the common goal; . In general, the contributions should be: Predictable, Comparable, Understandable. Provide information on assumptions that underpin the commitments: baseline year, timeframe, sectors and gases covered, emissions factors, methodology applied, use of markets, treatment of reduction units. A process for anchoring nationally defined contributions in the agreement;  Provisions related to accounting and transparency of action; Provisions related to the support, including finance, technology transfer, and capacity building specifically for mitigation actions; and Provisions related to market and nonmarket mechanisms and their role in the national and global mitigation efforts, including on co-benefits of mitigation actions that go beyond GHG reductions. A review mechanism of contributions should be included and allow for ambition to be updated on the basis of science in the light of any possible future gap to achieve the global goal of keeping the increase of global temperature below 2?C or 1.5?C. The provisions on mitigation must take into account that universality of application \\x1capplicable to all\\x1d does not mean uniformity. In AILAC\\x19s understanding the way to ensure equity is the implementation of a fair differentiation, where capacity and political will towards the highest level of ambition possible are at the core.  In this light, contributions should be nationally determined, based on the each country\\x19s national context, capabilities, responsibility and challenges. Support should be given to countries who need it most and who are willing to go beyond their capacity. Thus, differentiation must be between types of contributions. The agreement must put in place the right incentives so that all parties in a position to do so take action and become more ambitious. AILAC reiterates that leadership on mitigation should come from developed country parties, in light of their historic responsibility and their capacity. Without prejudice of this leadership that all developed countries should take, AILAC countries are also leading in the measure of their own capabilities, and often beyond their responsibility for climate change. We wish to highlight the need for all parties to be ambitious in contributing to global efforts to combat climate change according to their own capacities, under the leadership of developed country parties. REDD+: We believe that the contribution of REDD+ to global climate change mitigation efforts is substantial and can be enhanced. REDD+ is a fundamental part of national climate change strategies and should be considered in the future post 2020 instruments in its proper dimension.  Considering that REDD+ has been designed on the basis of a voluntary and cooperative initiative between developed and developing countries and that the REDD mechanism architecture was defined by the Warsaw REDD+ framework, there is a window of opportunity to include this mechanism, both at pre and post 2020 timeframes, in Work stream 1 and 2 of ADP. To achieve this goal, we believe that there is an urgent need to reach an agreement that provides sufficient, appropriate, transparent and predictable funding in the preR2020 timeframe to meet the expectations that have been generated. The need for REDD+ to be in place before 2020 is also relevant to foster synergies with other Conventions and help countries meet their Aichi 2020 targets for the Convention of Biological Diversity. In the post-2020 timeframe, we believe this mechanism should be considered as a priority, with the appropriate modifications in a post 2020 world, so it can continue to contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change. We hope that the spirit of constructiveness demonstrated during the REDD+ design process, continues to reflect the importance that forests have in global climate change mitigation efforts, while at the same time ensuring robust methodological frameworks to enhance environmental integrity. Adaptation and Loss and Damage Adaptation is a matter of collective responsibility on addressing climate change, ensuring sustainable development and eradication poverty, and should be treated as such under the Convention and in the new agreement. Climate change impacts, and thus adaptation opportunities are central to development efforts in developing countries in several sectors such as health, culture, water, food security, biodiversity and ecosystem services, affecting the most vulnerable and causing migrations and climate refugees. Contrary to what is commonly stated, adaptation is not only a local issue. Impacts and costs can be and should be assessed at local levels, but they can also be aggregated at national, regional, and global levels. Substantive, timely, and efficient investments in adaptation, as well as mitigation effort, are required to keep us within the adaptation context, when still possible, and not in a loss and damage setting. Loss and damage is however a reality for many countries and communities and thus should be addressed by the Convention and the new agreement. Both adaptation and loss & damage should be included as elements in the agreement to be agreed in Paris. There is an opportunity to further strengthen work on adaptation in the UNFCCC context, for instance an adaptation assessment framework must be established under the Convention. Also, and without prejudice of all institutional arrangements in place to support the LDCs, it is key that the focus on adaptation becomes broader, and includes all parties and not just developing countries. Within developing countries however, it is also important that more permanent and solid structures that support adaptation processes of nonRLDC parties are established, without undermining the existing ones in place for LDCs. We need to ensure coherence within the adaptation instruments and modalities approved to date under different platforms under the Convention, and the new post 2020 instrument should contribute to better structuring adaptation elements, a key priority for highly vulnerable countries like ours. Another opportunity for strengthening adaptation is further advancing on the metrics. We need to agree on methodologies to make adaptation assessments. Although this discussion is already ongoing under loss & damage, it should be brought also into the adaptation discussions. Only by measuring it is possible to understand the global implications of adaptation. Methodologies and indicators are fundamental for adaptation processes and the Convention should support parties in identifying costs, impacts, vulnerability, and baselines to measure progress. There should also be support for parties for sectoral and territorial adaptations options. Means of implementation are fundamental for developing country parties to be able to assess adaptation needs, and formulate and implement NAPS. Adaptation has been heavily underfunded and public funds are needed to support and catalyze action, as well as enhanced financial, technical and scientific support. Involvement of the private sector is also decisive for adaptation efforts in all countries, but concrete options and opportunities are not well understood and the Secretariat should assist countries in advancing on this front, beyond involvement of the insurance sector. The African Group\\x19s proposal con the adaptation goal is interesting and AILAC is looking forwards to have more in depth discussions on the proposal and how it might be included in the new agreement. The National Adaptation Plans NAPs) provide the essential basis for all countries to undertake necessary steps to identify and assess vulnerabilities and exposures within and across sectors, identify options, and define both soft and hard adaptation responses. For this purpose, there is a need for enhanced financial, technical and scientific support for countries to undertake these assessments, and formulate and implement NAPs. Clear support mechanisms for parties undertaking formulation or implementation of National Development Plans should be established. The Nairobi Work Programme should be strengthened and elements included under the Programme should be built upon in the new agreement and mainstreamed into the broader adaptation discussions. Loss & damage: The new agreement must build upon the Warsaw International Mechanism of Loss and Damage and its Work plan to ensure that the issue is given a central place under the new agreement. Efforts should be directed towards ensuring that the Executive Committee of the Mechanism is fully substantive and not bureaucratic, and focuses on developing countries\\x19 vulnerability and the identification of specific country needs. Also, given the mandate provides for progress on coordination among existing Convention bodies and coherence between different approaches to address loss and damage, special attention should be given to enhance the technical capacities of financial institutions in developing countries so as to identify the gaps and needs in the actions that will be undertaken. Means of Implementation: The new agreement will include a section on means of implementation that should include at least the following elements: An overarching guiding objective that should be the foundation of all the provision of means of implementation, addressing the need to transition to a world where all investments are climate friendly investments, and where climate finance, technology and capacity stop competing against carbonRintensive actions; Provisions on the national responsibility of all countries to mobilize and invest resources in climate friendly actions at the national level, and to mainstream climate change in national spending; An explicit reference to historical responsibility of developed countries and its relationship with the provision of climate finance to developing countries for contributing to their mitigation and adaptation efforts; A request to strengthen the existing provision of climate finance and enhance it significantly, to achieve the maximum level of ambition possible in the provision of means of implementation; Specific reference to the definition of nationally determined contributions on the provision of means of implementation that shall ensure that adaptation and mitigation action actually happen on the ground; these should be part of the overall process of defining the national contributions, and be subject to the same process of \\x1canchoring\\x1d in the legally binding agreement; A reference to the areas there the mean of implementation should be directed to be transformative in the results of the action implemented through them; Operational provisions related to the financial architecture of the Convention, the relationship of the compliance mechanism with the contributions of means of implementation, the MRV of support, among other operational issues. The contributions on the provision of means of implementation need also to be defined as soon as possible; their definition should be in line with what will be agreed on the process for the definition of the nationally determined contributions in general. The new legally binding agreement must ensure predictability in the medium and long term for the provision of the means of implementation, on the one hand, and on the other, provide all that is required for a transformation at scale in the way in which both public and private investments are made. Predictability and scale in the means of implementation are a fundamental requirement for this transition. The agreement must address the issue of means of implementation in a holistic manner, including the provision of finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. All of these elements are necessary to implement action on the ground and can be part of the nationally defined contributions \"',\n",
              "       '\"This statement is in name of the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). We partner with statements made for Bolivia on behalf of G77 + China and by the Philippines on behalf of the LMDC group. As ALBA countries we consider it important to highlight some points keys, which should guide the work of the Parties, in these negotiations under the Durban Platform. First of all, we want to emphasize the need for this process is fully developed under the principles and provisions of the Convention, in accordance with all the elements of the Decision is 1 / CP.17, 2 / CP.18 and 1 / CP.19. For this to be effective, it is crucial to guide the work based on the application of the Principle of Common But D ifferentiated Responsibilities, with developed countries taking the lead in reducing emissions and in fulfilling the commitments assumed under the Convention due to the debt and historical responsibility that the developed countries have before humanity. That leadership should be expressed in the form of commitments quantified, concrete and ambitious, which must be announced as soon as possible, to give impetus to this process. We warn that up to now these commitments are not being fulfilled, which set an inappropriate precedent for this negotiation. Co Presidents, ALBA\\'s expectations about work future of this Durban Platform group are intrinsically determined by this aspect, and linked to the result of the June ministerial meeting this year on the outcome of the June ministerial meeting this year on the ambition levels of the Ambition Partielevels of Parties to Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol It is necessary to emphasize that any action of the countries in development, according to the Convention, is subject to the provision of means of implementation (transfer of financing, technology and skills development), from the countries developed to developing countries, for which define a roadmap for effective financing and technological support for mitigation and adaptation actions that developing countries should voluntarily carry out. Is It is important to remember that Decision 1CP19 warns that the preparation of the \"\"nationally determined actions\"\", to which referred to in paragraph 2.b), are subject to financial support by developed countries, as noted in paragraph 2 d) of the own decision. For the ALBA Group, the \\x1cnational contributions certain \\x1ddefined in Decision 1CP / 19, refer to all elements of the new agreement and are therefore not limited to the mitigation. In addition, contributions in adaptation, loss and damage, financing, transfer of financing and technology, and capacity development. In In particular, developed countries must report on their financial contributions, consistent with the commitments that are already under the Convention today, and that until the moment have not been presented satisfactorily. Likewise, the ALBA group considers that the response \\x1dto climate change must be effectively considered and incorporated in the new agreement, understanding the integrated vision to interrelate the confrontation with climate change, with our right to comprehensive and sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and its extreme consequences. It is essential to ensure that the process is real and effective led by the Parties. Any document that is produced must conform only to the positions presented by the Parties. To advance in that direction, we need to adopt, since this Meeting a more structured way of working, a formal, transparent and inclusive process that produces authentic negotiation, under the absolute mandate of the Parties. Therefore, it requires a contact group for workstream 1. The legal nature of that Agreement should not be prejudged; We must apply the principle that form follows content. The substantive result of the negotiation will define the form of the agreement. These substantive results should cover, in a balanced way, the set of elements, agreed in Durban, that is: the adaptation, mitigation, finance, \"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me congratulate you on the important leadership you have demonstrated already this year and assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work together to achieve our common objectives. Thank you for your thoughtful scenario note, we agree with the priorities and mode of work it proposes for this session, while recognizing that our discussions should become increasingly focused as we move forward. We also fully recognize that this is a party-driven process and that we must soon move to direct consultations and negotiations between Parties. Co-Chairs, 2014 is a special year for our members. Just two weeks ago, at United Nations Headquarters in New York, we joined our colleagues in launching the International Year of Small Island Developing States-the first time a group of countries has been so recognized. The yearlong recognition is meant to call attention to the many contributions the people of Island Nations have made to our collective heritage as global citizens as well to raise awareness for the specific sustainable challenges facing SIDS, including the impacts of climate change. It also comes at a crossroads for our worl< here. If we fail to take bold action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, the opportunity to avert the worst impacts of the crisis may be irrevocably lost. We welcome the opening of the technical expert meetings under Workstream 2 of the ADP and are eager to translate the lessons we learn into concrete progress and real mitigation action on the ground. We think the focus here on renewable energy and energy efficiency provides an opportunity to focus on an area of high mitigation potential and to highlight areas where intensive cooperation among governments, international organizations and financial institutions, the private sector and civil society can produce new mitigation ambition, including through matching bright ideas with international support. It is also important to be mindful that these efforts have significant co-benefits for sustainable development and adaptation. We look forward to this work? informing the ministerial discussions on ambition in June and help expedite actions to be launched at the UN Secretary-General\\'s Summit in September. We will also continue to encourage Parties to raise the ambition of their 2020 pledges, or to come forward with new pledges for those who have not yet done so, and we think Workstream 2 will help give us all confidence that we can in fact do what is necessary. Co-Chairs, In terms of the 2015 agreement (under Workstream 1), we must also make clear progress and continue to build on the foundation of the Convention, including all of its principles and provisions. The fact that we are now negotiating a new protocol applicable to all does not relieve developed countries of their responsibility to tak:e the lead in addressing climate change. We cannot afford any backsliding in the type, nature, or ambition of their mitigation commitments under the 2015 agreement. The outcome of the Paris conference in 2015 should be a legally binding Protocol under the Convention that is applicable to all Parties, which will require universal participation and contributions from all parties. The safety, viability and survival of our members demands that the agreement be based on science and include a global goal of limiting global warming to well below 1.5 degrees. Therefore, we reiterate that the outcome of the 2013-2015 Review is central to the Workstream 1 process to ensure that we are meeting our imperatives. In this context, the level of ambition of the 2015 agreement is critical to the survival of SIDS. We are therefore proposing that this session focus on the following, inter alia: First, We should begin the identification of the elements that would be included in the final 2015 agreement. Second, We encourage focus on identifying the information needed to allow parties to present their information in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency, and understanding of nationally determined contributions. Third, This will inform a process that would lead to an urgent submission of parties\\' proposed national contributions in a transparent and verifiable manner that enables quantification and assessment against the long-term global goal of holding warming below 1.SC; and move toward a process to review proposed n\"\"tional contributions. Furthermore it must articulate: A balanced treatment of mitigation and adaptation, including a clearly defined relationship between mitigation ambition and adaptation costs as well as loss and damage, particularly when adaptation measures are not sufficient to address climate impacts; and A provision for long-term, scaled up, predictable, new and additional finance, technology and capacity building to cover the costs of adaptation and loss and damage. Unfortunately, we know that severe climate impacts are already occurring and that much worse still lies ahead. Only last week the Marshall Islands and Kiribati were severely da\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of Brazil, China, South Africa and India. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. At the outset, we would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of the Co-Chairs in facilitating the ADP negotiation process in Warsaw last year and assure you of our continued support and cooperation in the ADP negotiations this year. Mr. Co-Chairs, We welcome the progress on the Durban Platform made in Warsaw. We are however concerned with the effective implementation of the Bali outcomes in Warsaw as well as the period from now to 2020. The effective implementation of the Bali, Cancun, Durban and Doha outcomes will be paramount for trust building amongst Parties in order to create the necessary conditions and an international enabling environment for a successful conclusion of the work on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. Mr. Co-Chairs The ADP Warsaw Decision further reiterates that the Durban Platform is under the Convention and shall be guided by the principles of the Convention, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibiltties. This has been emphasized in Durban and Doha decisions. It is important to once again remind ourselves that the Durban Platform is to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. This means that the 2015 agreement must strengthen the multilateral, rule-based system under the Convention It is by no means to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure, or reinterpret the Convention or its principles, provisions and Annexes. It shall be based on science and the principles of equity and CBDR, as well as the promotion of sustainable development. In order for the Durban Platform process to raise the level of ambition, the 2015 agreement must adhere to the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Articles 4 and 12 as per the Annexes, which fully reflect the common but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries. In decision1CP/19, in Warsaw, we decided to elaborate, beginning at the first session of ADP in 2014, the elements for a draft negotiating text. We stress that the 2015 agreement should address all elements referred to in paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17, i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support, in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and should not just be confined to mitigation. Mr. Co-Chairs, The Warsaw ADP decision also invited all Parties to initiate and intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions and to identify the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions. However, with regard to the intended nationally determined contributions, it is important to understand that contributions should cover all the pillars of the Convention, i.e. mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance and technology to developing countries, and be in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular the Article 4 of the Convention. We call on developed countries to make their preparations and include in their submissions information particular on the provision of 2 finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries in addition to their mitigation commitments. Developing country Parties\\' contributions will be in the context of sustainable development, and dependent on the financial and technological support provided by developed country Parties. We also believe that information to facilitate the understanding and transparency of the contributions shall be differentiated between developed and developing countries. The Durban Platform has already traversed half of its destination in terms of allotted time but the final destination in terms of substance is still a distant reality. With only less than two years left for the Paris Conference, it would be timely and befitting to start the formal negotiations on the elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text. We therefore believe that it is important to switch-over from the mode of open-ended consultations to a contact group format focusing on the six core elements mandated by decision 1/CP.17. The outcomes in a textual or written form should come from Parties in a Partydriven and consensus-building manner. Mr. Co-Chairs, The pre-2020 ambition must cover mitigation, adaptation and provision of finance and technology support to developing countries. We urge developed country Parties participating in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to revisit and significantly increase their emission reduction targets in 2014, and urge developed countries that are not part of the second commitment period to also revisit and raise the ambition of their commitments under the Convention within the same timeframe and in a comparable manner. If the developed countries had committed to an emission reduction of 40% below their 1990 levels by 2020, the pre-2020 mitigation gap would not even have existed. The 2014 Revisit as set out in para.7 to 11 of decision 1/CMP.8 and para.4(c) of decision 1/CP.19 should be fully and effectively implemented as soon as possible. Developed countries should also honour 3 and fulfill their commitments on providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries during the pre-2020 period. We also urge those Annex I Parties that have not put forward a pre-2020 quantified economy-wide emission reduction target to do so. We further note with concern that the mitigation contribution by developing country Parties is much greater than that by developed country Parties. The concern is not that developing countries are doing more than the developed countries but on the rather low ambition levels of developed countries. It is simply not acceptable that the commitments of developed countries should be transferred to developing countries and more so through initiatives outside the Convention. While we recognise the potential of international cooperative initiatives to advance our efforts to combat climate change, these initiatives must be treated in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Mr. Co-Chairs, We would like to reiterate our full commitment and support to you in taking the ADP process forward, with a view to making a balanced and comprehensive progress in an open and transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-building manner. I thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chair, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG. Mr Co-Chair. First of all, the EIG would like to thank you and your Co-Chair for the informal note reflecting progress made during our last meeting and laying out your vision for this decisive year of ADP. The note captures very well the progress achieved and draws our attention on the next steps needed. The EIG supports your arrangements to continue in a informal setting with a focused technical expert discussion on areas with high mitigation potential, in parallel to a more political discussion on ADP agenda Item 3. We think that this discussion should focus on ADP WS 1 to allow maximum progress in identifying elements which will later this year be crystalized into draft text. Mr Co-Chair. The ADP here in Bonn must take a significant step towards the 2015 Agreement. This meeting should achieve at least three objectives: It should advance our common understanding of core elements of the 2015 outcome, including that it may include three levels: a legally binding instrument, COP decisions including guidelines, and nationally determined contributions. It should advance our confidence that all Parties will undertake the efforts needed to submit well in advance of COP21, by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so, their intended nationally determined contributions, and that most Parties will be able to do so. It should also advance our common understanding which information will have to be provided together with the intended nationally determined contributions, And finally, it should help each of us and all of us together to unlock opportunities for increasing efforts to reduce emissions before 2020. Mr Co-Chair. The discussions throughout this week will allow us to focus constructively on the central elements of the 2015 outcome. Let me highlight some of the elements which the EIG considers to be key for a success in Paris: The 2015 must provide a robust and credible framework for the global climate change regime post-2020. As agreed in Durban, it must ensure that all Parties formulate commitments, including targets or actions, based on the same legal form and on the same internationally agreed rules, at differentiated depth according to CBDR and RC. We need a rules-based - yet dynamic and flexible - and a committing regime with the participation of all Parties reflecting the changing economic realities, national circumstances, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. With the same priority, we must address adaptation under the 2015 Agreement - in a differentiated manner as required. The 2015 Agreement shall promote cooperation in adaptation in view to increase adaptive capacity and resilience of all Parties in the context of sustainable development. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement must be underpinned by adequate, integrated and transparent means of implementation. Based on a clear global vision on support, effective financial mechanism should be duly reflected in the 2015 Agreement and be operated from contributions from developed Parties and those in the position to do so according to their responsibilities, capacities and equity. The EIG is very concerned about the lack of progress of the work within the GCF Executive Board. We urge all the members of the GCF Executive Board to be fully commited and finalize the essential requirements of the GCF business model framework by the May meeting as scheduled. Mr Co-Chair. Pre-2020 Mitigation Ambition is another urgent workstream under the ADP. The current global mitigation ambition falls short from the recommendations by science to hold global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius - we have to strengthen international cooperation on immediate additional actions. (Here in Bonn we will be able to engage in a focused and technical work under the ADP workstream 2 examining concrete options to increase ambition on renewable energy and energy efficiency. At the same time,) we should further foster initiatives additional to the current mitigation commitments, such as those announced in Warsaw. Thank you, Mr Co-Chair. If process issues around contact groups will happen: The EIG is strongly commited to engage on substiantial matters under the ADP. It is the groups view that at this stage the continuation of the informal setting in two workstreams is most benefitial - the EIG does not support the creation of contact groups at this stage. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We are now past the halfway stage in the life of the ADP and with less than two years to secure an ambitious 2015 Agreement at COP 21 in Paris, the work that lies before us is challenging and urgent. But that is a challenge that we must collectively meet. The positive result of COP19, and the spirit of compromise and cooperation which enabled that result, provides a good platform for our work in 2014. It is essential that we get down to business quickly and efficiently here in Bonn, bearing in mind the need for a draft negotiating text of the 2015 Agreement to emerge by Lima. In relation to work towards the 2015 Agreement, the EU sees that the priority for our work this week is to make progress towards agreeing the requirements for upfront information to be supplied with intended nationally determined mitigation contributions, so that they are transparent, quantifiable, comparable, verifiable and ambitious. Progress also needs to be made towards further elaborating the rules base of the 2015 Agreement - in particular the MRV and accounting rules that will be needed in the context of a variety of possible mitigation commitment types. Clearly adaptation and means of implementation will also need to be addressed this week. Several Parties, including the EU, have put forward ideas in these areas that could usefully form the basis of further and deeper discussions towards elaborating the elements of the 2015 Agreement. We very much welcome the inclusion of the workshop on the domestic preparations for intended nationally determined contributions. This will be an important opportunity to take stock of the work that countries have initiated on their contributions and to highlight some of the activities being undertaken to support countries in their preparations. The EU and its Member States have begun the process to prepare their mitigation contribution, and we look forward to sharing information on this and exchanging ideas with other Parties. The briefing by relevant organisations and UN agencies on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined contributions is also a welcome initiative to highlight the support that is available to those countries that need it. In relation to the work on raising the mitigation ambition of all Parties before 2020 we welcome the approach of convening technical expert meetings that focus on particular issues. Whilst energy efficiency and renewable energy are the focus for March, we look forward to other aspects being the focus of our work in June - for example REDD+ and the phasing down of HFCs. The EU would like to see a list of policy options emerging from the technical process that would be captured in the reflections note and inform an update of the Secretariat technical paper. Political leadership is essential to make progress in 2014 - a year the UN Secretary-General has dubbed the \"\"year of climate action\"\". We must take the opportunity to harness political will through the June Ministerial session, the UN Secretary General??s Leaders?? Summit in September, as well as COP 20 in Lima. In conclusion - we look forward to working in 2014 with our negotiating partners and the coChairs, building on the progress and outcomes achieved in Warsaw.\"',\n",
              "       '\"I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The Group assures you of our willingness to continue to engage cooperatively with all Parties in this working Group to successfully accomplish the mandate that we have given ourselves. For this, we need to move beyond an exchange of ideas and engage in substantive negotiation. We trust that you as our co-Chairs will facilitate our work, based on decision 1/CP.17, 2/CP.18 and l/CP.19 towards elements for a draft negotiating text based on inputs and submissions by Partes. And toward enhanced ambition pre-2020 in accordance with the Durban Mandate. Mr. Co-Chairs, The successful accomplishment of work before us will require us to consider the elements and contributions in a comprehensive manner. The Group stresses the importance of giving balanced consideration to how all elements, not only mitigation, has a role to play in reaching a successful outcome. The consideration of the element of \"\"support\"\" is essential for the Group, particularly in the context of an \"\"ex-ante\"\" discussion on the elements and contributions of Parties and to understand how said support will be delivered in a predictable and accessible manner, to assist developing country Parties in accordance with principles and provisions of the Convention. The elements of support, in terms of finance, technology and capacity-building, are issues of ongoing discussions under the Convention, and our work must build upon these. Mr. Co-Chairs, A comprehensive consideration of the elements and contributions requires the consideration of adaptation actions and measures. The Group wishes to signal concern over the absence of adaptation in our discussions. We 1 urge Parties to give adaptation due consideration and likewise to all aspects of our work.  The Group approaches the substantive work ahead of us bearing in mind that the role of Parties can not be replaced. It is Parties that will have to reach an agreement. We must therefore avoid any mode of work that could take down the path of having to take important decisions in a manner that does not allow careful reflection and equal opportunity for all delegations, large or small. In this context, we take the opportunity to reiterate the six points raised last year on behalf of the Group as the Group position on ADP; a) The work under the Ad-hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles. and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities; The negotiations under the ADP must be a party-driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent; The work in this Ad-hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and f) Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. Mr. Co-Chairs, In the work of the ADP under work-stream 2, as we have also stated previously, developed countries must demonstrate clear and unconditional leadership in mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology development and transfer. In this regard, the Group of 77 and China expects that the amendments adopted in Doha in relation to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol enter into force as soon as possible. It is paramount that the ambition mechanism launched in Doha effectively results in the increase of the ambition of Annex I Parties\\' quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments for the second commitment period. We therefore urge all Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to go through the relevant legal procedures necessary to bring the amendments into force as soon as possible, and to revisit and significantly increase their quantified emissions reduction and limitation commitments by 2014. It is crucial that we should ensure the 2 operationalization and implementation of the 2014 Revisit Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol in Warsaw. We likewise urge non-KP Annex I Parties to increase their mitigation ambition in a comparable manner within the same timeframe. All Annex I Parties must undertake additional verifiable actions under the Kyoto Protocol, as well as under the Convention with a view to close the ambition gap by 2020. The enhanced commitments from the Annex I Parties in 2014 for the post-2020 period should be the first step, since this would directly impact the level of ambition in workstream 1 for the post-2020 period. The members of Group of 77 and China have made greater contributions on combating climate change than those of developed countries during the pre2020 period. We urge developed country Parties to fulfill and enhance their commitments on the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries, which is fundamental for developing countries to implement our actions on adaptation and mitigation. Mr. Co-Chairs. With these words, we would like to assure you of the Group\\'s continued cooperation and we look forward to engaging meaningfully with all our partners in the coming week. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, distinguished delegates, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the LDC Group. We associate with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China, Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, and Nauru on behalf of the AOSIS. We thank the Secretariat for the preparations made for this meeting and also thank the government and people of Germany for their warm hospitality as usual. Co-Chairs, we congratulate you for your excellent work in Warsaw. We welcome all your efforts to keep us up-to-date and up-to-speed through informal, scenario and reflection notes. We also appreciate \\x1cthe co-chairs corner\\x1d on the website informing us on your various inter-sessional activities. Co-chairs, our overall impression on the Warsaw ADP outcome is that it helped us to make progress under few elements, but it also pushed us back on some fundamental elements, including the legal perspective of the ADP outcome. We strongly believe that the final contributions of Parties should be anchored in the 2015 agreement in the form of commitments. We are also concerned that the deadline and the process for delivering pledges agreed in Warsaw is too late and does not allow sufficient time for review. Also, no formal process for such a review of pledges has been agreed. Co-Chairs, our tasks in Bonn include making the necessary arrangements to ensure high ambition upfront, when Parties make their first offers. Our aim should be to encourage earlier actions by the end of December 2014 for those countries that are willing and capable to do so. We look forward to hearing from Parties concerning the initiatives they are undertaking to prepare their national contributions. As LDCs, we do not have adequate capacity to undertake such preparations and will need support to enable us to do so. In Bonn, we must also strive to progress in refining elements for the draft negotiating text and make clear progress on the issue of the adequacy of both individual and aggregate mitigation commitments will be kept well below 1.5??C by the end of the century 9. Co-Chairs, on the short-term ambition (WS2), the LDCs strongly believe that Parties must accelerate the technical examination of actions with high mitigation potentials with a view to implement those actions as early as possible in area\"',\n",
              "       '\"Good morning. The Philippines has the pleasure of making this opening statement on behalf of the LikeMinded Developing Countries (LMDC) in the UNFCCC. The LMDC fully supports the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, We are now more than halfway in the timeline of our journey together under the ADP from Durban in December 2011 to Paris in December 2015. In the past two years, we have had informal consultations among the Parties that gave us a better understanding of each other\\'s views, ideas, starting points, and objectives for this process. Divergences and convergences have emerged. The challenge clearly is on expanding convergence and narrowing divergence on the basis of consensus by shifting from an informal mode of work to a formal, transparent and participatory negotiating process of the Parties and by the Parties, as quickly as possible. The time for this is now. The common objective must be to active at an agreed outcome in Paris that is balanced, comprehensive, credible, legitimate, and acceptable to all, so that all will implement it. The outcome must be consistent with the Convention, enhances its full, effective and sustained implementation, and avoids re-writing or reinterpreting any of its provisions or principles. Most importantly, the principles of equity and CBDR must remain the bedrock of the 2015 agreed outcome. At the same time, however, despite the long-standing commitments of developed country Parties under the Convention since 1992, the effects of their historical responsibility for emissions coupled by the lack or inadequacy of their efforts on climate change are now making themselves deeply felt through the acceleration and widening of the adverse effects of climate change on our peoples. Many developing countries of the LMDC and of our broader family, the G77, are suffering massively from these adverse effects. This highlights the urgency that we must all feel in carrying out our work under the ADP. This also underlines the need for developed country Parties to finally take up the mantle of leadership that they have long been called to take up under the Convention, rather than seeking to escape from it or transferring the responsibility to those who still face major sustainable development and poverty eradication challenges. This includes, in particular, ratifying Annex I Parties no later than the end of 2014 the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol with respect to its second commitment period so that it can enter into force as soon as possible before 2020. Co-Chairs, For any agreed outcome to be credible and legitimate, it must be the product of a formal, transparent and participatory negotiating process driven by the Parties in which the Parties negotiate with each other on the basis of good faith and in the spirit of mutual understanding. At this session of the ADP, formal and structured intergovernmental negotiations on the elements for a draft negotiating text of the 2015 agreed outcome must start through the establishment by the ADP of a contact group for Workstream I focusing on the six core elements referred to in the Durban and Doha mandate, ie. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support. The proceedings of this contact group must be open to observers. They, too, have a stake in this process. Through such formal negotiations, a negotiating text should be developed from a compilation transparently drawn from and attributed to Parties\\' textual submissions. We emphasize that only formal negotiations in a contact group can ensure that our substantive discussions under the ADP are proceeding in the right direction to Paris so that we can adopt a balanced agreed outcome by the end of COP21 in 2015. The negotiations in the contact group under the ADP must follow a logical sequence as stated in paragraph 2(a) of decision 1/CP 19. It must start with further elaborating, beginning at its first session in 2014, the elements identified in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17 for a draft negotiating text, followed by negotiations on contributions, and then on information. In this context, the provision of support by developed countries to developing countries for their domestic preparations with respect to information on their contributions is necessary and must be done in a timely and adequate manner. The provision of support is a concrete commitment by developed country Parties rather than those of international organizations. Co-Chairs, in this negotiating process, we expect you to allow and provide time for Parties and their groups to coordinate and consult within and among themselves. Your facilitation of this process as the ADP CoChairs is important to us. Any guidance from you, such as questions that you put to us like those in paragraphs 13 to 17 of your scenario note, should be balanced. The questions to be discussed in the negotiations are directly related to the substance. Such questions should follow the mandate from Durban and Doha and be determined by all Parties in a Party-driven and consensus.building 1nanner, in order to reflect different concerns and views of all Parties in a balanced manner. We stress that procedures or processes that are non-participatory or nontransparent, or which limit effective involvement to only a few Parties rather than all the Parties, must be avoided. No less than the chance of actually having a 2015 agreed outcome, as well as the credibility, legitimacy, and acceptability of such outcome, are at stake. Co-Chairs, The LMDC has just inade a submission on the elements for the 2015 agreed outcome. In our submission, we have outlined the way in which the elements of the 2015 agreed outcome - namely mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building, and transparency of action and support - could be fleshed out in a manner that is fully consistent with the principles, provisions, structure and annexes of the Convention, builds on previous COP decisions, and leads to enhanced action by all Parties to achieve the objective of the Convention. In mitigation, there should be CBDR-based differentiation between developed and developing countries, MRV of support, and response measures. Under adaptation, Annex II parties should fulfill their commitments to support developing countries to address the adverse effects of climate change, including loss and damage as well as economic diversification. The other elements under finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support, should also be enhanced consistent with the Convention. In short, our submission points the way by which an equitable, ambitious, and effective outcome can be achieved in Paris by the end of COP21 in a manner that respects the mru1date of the ADP, enhances implementation of the Convention, and enhances international cooperation and don1estic contributions by all Parties fully in accordance with the provisions and principles of the Convention, in particular equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The way that we have suggested will allow us to reach a balanced, comprehensive, and satisfactory agreement within the timeline to Paris that remains to us under the ADP. However, proposals that are not consistent with the Convention, or which seek to rewrite or re-interpret it, are not helpful to the process that we are in. They only cause delay and confusion, and will drastically reduce the possibility of reaching a credible, legitimate, and acceptable outco1ne in Paris by the end of COP21. Co-Chairs, With regards to Workstream 2, enhancing pre-2020 ambition holistically includes mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology transfer. It should be achieved through the implementation of the Bali outcomes. The pre-2020 mitigation gap would be closed if developed country Parties committed to an aggregate emission reduction of more than 40o/o below their 1990 levels by 2020, even as developing countries are already contributing more to global mitigation efforts than developed countries. All developed country Parties should revisit and increase their pre-2020 mitigation ambition in order to set a high starting point and reference level for determining their post-2020 mitigation commitments. While technical expert meetings help implement paragraph 5 of decision l/CP.19, we would like to emphasize that paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of this COP decision should be addressed in a balanced manner. Enough space and time slots in the ADP process should be secured to discuss the issue of the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of decision l/CP.19 in 2014. International cooperative initiatives may facilitate the implementation by developing countries of their presented actions but should not transfer to developing countries the commitments and obligations of developed countries. The LMDC, representing developing countries whose populations daily face the multidimensional challenges of achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty while at the same time addressing the adverse effects of climate change, wish to see positive progress in our negotiations under the ADP. We wish to see success crown our collective efforts Wlder the ADP, first at COP20 in Lima this year in elaborating the elements and then at COP21 in Paris with respect to an agreed outcome. To this end, Co-Chairs, we will continue to be constructive and positively engaged with you and our partners in order to collectively construct a better future for us and for future generations under the Convention. Thank you, Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. The ADP has set itself a full agenda this year and we have limited opportunities to advance work. So consistent with the ADP Co-Chair\\'s scenario note, we are ready to get to work immediately on the key tasks for the year: We look forward to working with parties here to identify elements for a 2015 agreement. Taken together, those elements should create an ambitious, inclusive and durable agreement, which requires all Parties to the agreement to put forward nationally-determined mitigation contributions, and which all Parties can view as being fair, including through an exchange of information about intentions for planning and managing the process. We are also ready to begin the process of identifying the up-front information that needs to accompany Parties\\' national contributions to ensure that they are clear, transparent, and quantifiable. What we all need to do in an efficient way, is to develop a better understanding of assumptions underpinning these contributions. We envision a simple list of essential elements that Parties should submit to make sure that Parties understand what others are contributing. Back home, we are examining how to elaborate our intended nationally determined contributions, so as to meet the timetable we agreed in Warsaw, and we\\'ve been working to identify avenues to support the efforts of other countries as they prepare intended nationally determined contributions that fit their national circumstances and capabilities. And, finally, we will be coming together to contemplate further steps to advance practical climate action in the period to 2020 by sharing our experiences and understanding how we can best build further action. There are many options to choose from, and the technical expert meetings should give us the time and space to focus our attention on areas of untapped mitigation. We do not start these tasks from scratch, but should build on the constructive work of the last two years and accelerate the process to meet this timeframe. In this time, we have started to hear growing areas of convergence on where the 2015 agreement can promote ambitious mitigation action. As we go forward, we need a process that is flexible enough to allow for deeper investigation of specific concepts and ideas, but which ensures that the 2015 agreement continues to develop as a coherent whole. In coming to an elements text we will need to give further thought to the form and structure of a 2015 agreement, considering what elements are best placed in a durable core agreement and which can be developed in parallel decisions and outcomes. We will also need to come to a common understanding about how to give effect to the principles of the Convention, in a way that is appropriate to an agreement that will start in 2020 and potentially operate for decades beyond. With respect to CB DR/RC in particular, a binary approach to differentiation will not serve this purpose. We will need a more nuanced approach that allows fill countries to participate in climate action in a way that fits their individual national circumstances, complements their economic advancement plans and priorities, and allows continuous evolution and improvement as circumstances and capacities evolve. Co-Chairs. In workstream 2, we have engaged constructively in conversations on initiatives to h.elp enhance pre-2020 mitigation ambition, and heard many examples of the action that is taking place. We look forward to participating this week in deeper technical exchanges on renewable energy and energy efficiency and sharing our experiences. We recognise that all countries need to act further to help close the gap between current pledges and what is required to meet the below 2-degree goal. We also welcome the opportunity to further engage business, civil society, and various issue experts on the ways and initiatives to drive innovative mitigation and adaptation efforts in the short term. Many countries have acted in a variety of ways to reduce emissions, and we must continue to incentivise further action. We also continue to encourage countries that have not yet made a 2020 pledge- including 20 of the top 50 emitters - to do so. These countries represent some 17% of global emissions, compared to the around 10% of emissions now covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Co-Chairs. We appreciate the guidance you continue to provide to our process and we look forward to working with you and others in a productive session here in Bonn. Thank You.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of Countries. This week, we have made progress sharing views on the emerging elements of the 2015 Agreement, and sharing lessons on technical options for pursuing untapped renewable energy and energy efficiency potential. Like others, we are conscious that we are now more than halfway through our process and that we need to target our work toward delivering the Warsaw Decision in line with the timetable agreed in Durban. We want to expedite work on substance, and accelerate progress to meet our goals. This will require further focused work in the ADP that lets us build convergence on elements for the 2015 agreement. It will require more focused work at the next session to provide guidance on the up-front information to accompany post-2020 nationally determined contributions. Each country will need to continue progressing national preparations to bring forward an intended nationally determined contribution in line with the timeline agreed in Warsaw. And we also look forward to advancing work on further technical options for capturing mitigation potential. We like others highlight the importance of a Party driven process. We as Parties agreed on a set of Decisions in Warsaw and we will have to work together to deliver it, under your guidance. As you have described it, we understand the basis on which Parties have agreed to move forward under the modality of a Contact Group as being: A Contact Group will be established here today and we will resume in this format at our session in June; This Contact Group will be established to consider our existing agenda, including both workstreams of the ADP}and you will continue to facilitate the Contact Group as CoChair4 It will proceed in line with our current organisation of work which is to continue to advance workstream 1 in a single group for all Parties and observers, and workstream 2 through technical and other meetings; Time will be given at June to each of the tasks decided at Warsaw, covering the elements of the 2015 agreement, up-front information and technical work to raise ambition; The Warsaw Decision is to develop elements for a negotiating text. We see the best way for us to move toward convergence is to focus our efforts on thinking about elements for text, rather than entering into a detailed text compilation exercise. Elements for text will be developed based on the views provided by Parties in their written submissions and also during the course of negotiations, noting it is just as important to capture the work we have done in session to develop the elements of the 2015 agreement. And as we move forward we will maintain an integrated and coherent approach to the 2015 agreement, which does not approach work though silo-ed thematic elements, but looks at how elements can functionally be brought together into a 2015 agreement and broader package, in a way that considers overarching issues of form and structure. Thank You\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you. Co-Presidents. We make the following statement on behalf of the countries of the Alliance Bolivarian for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). We associate ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 + China and for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in Representation of the Group of Countries in the Development of Like Ideas. ALBA highlights the importance that this country has for our countries process and our wish that these negotiations in the framework of the Durban Platform achieve the results that our peoples they demand: having concrete and effective results so that the developed countries make effective commitments to mitigating climate change and the climate debt to developing countries. At ALBA we are committed to advancing a process that this framed in the Convention, to fully contemplate all its principles and provisions, the Common Responsibilities But Differentiated and Equity, and that allows reversing the effects of global warming that is already severely occurring in our countries with increasing frequency and severity. We consider that a positive signal is necessary at the next meeting ministerial to be held in June this year on the levels of ambition under the Kyoto Protocol. On the eve of The commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol is unfortunate that there are still no positive signs from the countries Annex I in relation to the commitment to comply with the historical responsibilities and with the legal obligation that they acquired from sign the Kyoto Protocol. To date, it has not been produced by Annex I countries ratification of the Doha amendment to the Protocol from Kyoto. The countries of Annex I, which are part of the second period of commitments and the rest of developed countries, must show the leadership in reducing emissions and in complying with commitments made under the Convention due to climate debt that developed countries have before humanity for the overexploitation of common global resources, such as the atmosphere, assuming the debt and historical responsibility that the countries developed have before humanity and Mother Earth. Paradoxically, the measures proposed by the countries responsible for climate change are still pointed in the direction of rescuing the system that has caused the problem. ALBA considers it important that for the next session in June establish adequate spaces that allow the Parties to negotiate between Parties and to be able to get to Lima with the negotiating text of the Parties themselves. To do this, the organization of negotiations in the next session in June is essential, so that it allows a structured contact group that is balanced, transparent and inclusive and under the absolute mandate of the Parties. ALBA expresses its disagreement with the way they have been carried out the negotiations at this ADP session in Bonn, which undermine the foundations of multilateral negotiation, since the decisions that should be taken the first day, such as establishing a contact group, just are taken on the last day of this session. It is also observed the real contribution that the Expert Groups may have to the prioritize only mitigation and propose mostly measures domestic that would require large national resources that are so necessary for the eradication of poverty of our peoples, and without there is still clarity about the ambition in technology transfer, financing and capacity building. Mr. Co Presidents. We hope that the June session program will meet expectations of work, methodology and modalities expressed here. ALBA reiterates its full commitment, with the achievement of a fair agreement and balanced according to the principles of the Convention, which ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promote the urgent adaptation to climate change and compensation for damage and lost, and the integrity of our Mother Earth is respected. Finally, on behalf of ALBA we want to thank the countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region for recognition and full support from the Latin American and Caribbean region to the efforts of the democratically elected government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as well as its support in the preparations to celebrate the First Social Pre-COP of the Convention, before Lima. Thank you Mr. Co-Presidents. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of BASIC. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, As we close the proceedings for this session, we are concerned about the slow progress we are making towards the tasks assigned to us by the Durban mandate, Doha and the Warsaw decisions. We came to Bonn with a clear intent to engage in an open and transparent, inclusive and party-driven inter-governmental negotiations on the initial elaboration of elements of a draft negotiating text as identified in para 5 of decision 1/CP.17. However, unfortunately it seems that this session has seen a further reiteration of ideas and positions already outlined at the roundtables and workshops during the last two years rather than the initial elaboration of elements of a draft negotiating text. Therefore, we are of the view that it is important to rapidly move into a clearly structured formal negotiation process in a contact group setting. Co-Chairs, We would like to request for further clarity regarding the plan and mode of work of this proposed Contact group in order to start negotiating on the substantial elements at the June session. To us, the work of the Contact group must be conducted in a formal and structured manner on the basis of text-based negotiations. As usual, the text will come from the parties by way of submissions or textual proposals during negotiations. We believe that sufficient and balanced negotiating time must be allocated for negotiations on all six core elements of a draft negotiating text covering mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support. Co-Chairs, The BASIC Group would also request for a clear plan of work for the remaining meetings of the ADP up to COP 20 in Lima in order to enable delegations to prepare for the sessions and make submissions accordingly. We must also note that in our future plan of work, due consideration must be given to discussions on para 3 & 4 of the Warsaw decision and in selection of areas of high-mitigation potential for technical expert meetings. Co-Chairs, With regard to more substantive issues, we concur with the common understanding, voiced by developing countries that the term \\'nationally determined contributions\\' covers all the operational pillars of the Convention, i.e mitigation, adaptation, financial, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support for developing country implementation. In this regard, our understanding of the objective of the final 2015 agreement must have at its core the strengthening and enhancement of the implementation of the provisions of the Convention, in particular its Article 4, in a manner that gives full effect to its principles, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Therefore, our contention is that the commitments included in the NDCs for the developed country parties will, for mitigation, retain the already agreed form of commitment, namely quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and in addition developed country NDC\\'s should clearly define their commitments to the provision of finance, technology development and transfer as well as capacity building support to enable developing country implementation of the Convention. Given the recognition in the Convention that developing countries have overriding priorities to address poverty, it is already agreed that their contribution to the global climate change effort and therefore their NDCs are in the context of sustainable development. In this regard, the 2015 agreement must incorporate the recognition of the Convention that the extent to which developing countries will be able to meet their commitments is dependent on the extent to which developed countries meet their financial and technological as well as capacity-building support commitments in accordance with Article 4.7 of the Convention. Given the diversity of types of actions and commitments of developing countries as opposed to the quantified emission reduction targets of developed countries, it is a common understanding of developing countries that the information to facilitate the understanding of the contributions are necessarily differentiated between developed and developing countries. Therefore, we would once again strongly emphasize our proposal for the 2015 agreement to build upon the structure of the Convention, in order to strengthen and enhance the implementation of its provisions, in accordance with its principles and through the institutions and structures built over the years. We should therefore move into a formal mode of negotiation in the June session to build understanding on elements of the draft negotiation text keeping in mind the above conceptual articulation that under-pin proposals from developing countries. Co-Chairs. We highly appreciate the fact that you were always accessible to listen to our proposals, suggestions and concerns. On behalf of the BASIC Group, you can be rest assured of our continued and constructive engagement with all groups and parties as well as our full support to you in this crucial phase of upcoming formal negotiations. I thank you, Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"I have the honor to intervene on behalf of the AILAC group of countries. First of all, we wish to associate ourselves with the intervention made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Presidents. AILAC thanks you for the efforts and hard work you have put into guiding our discussions and our work. We have had a very productive week in which we have had the opportunity to understand each other better, advance the ideas we are working on, and start the process of defining those that They will be the details of the future legally binding agreement. Informal consultations helped us to have more clarity on the six elements included in the Durban\\'s decision, as well as the architecture of the future agreement. The technical meetings of experts They also made it possible to advance in the identification of specific examples that will contribute to our work under work-stream 2. We see two challenges on the way forward: First, we see the need to advance the transition to a new way of working in Junia with caution and good judgment. This transition brings with it the challenge of starting to discuss the draft text of negotiation to be agreed in Lima at COP20. This will require that we have a strong sense of appropriation against the text that we work, and that at the same time define an efficient, rational way of working, and that allows us to deliver optimal results. Second, we must identify the elements that will allow us to raise expectations under the work-stream 2, going from a technical initial phase, to a political phase through which we can achieve an impact significant to increase the level of ambition in pre-2020 mitigation and financing. Co-Presidents, AILAC continues ready to continue working to face these challenges, and to accelerate the process that allow to have results in Lima. We are encouraged by the fact that we will arrive in June ready to start the work noun immediately. It also encourages hearing so many voices around the table that they are ready to work this way. We fully trust that you will guide and assist us, as we have been doing, to achieve this objective. In accordance with the position expressed by the G77 president, we are convinced that starting the June meeting as the fifth part of the second ADP session, under a single contact group, is the way forward. We are confident that this will allow all of us, the States parties, to continue enriching our understanding of the issues to be addressed, and to begin to engage in frank negotiations that will allow us to pave the way for the adoption of a draft text at COP20 in Lima.  Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China as well as Sudan on behalf of the LDCs. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for conducting such an effective session this week and assure you of the full trust and confidence we have in your leadership. We welcome the agreement to establish a contact group at the next meeting and look forward to making further progress under both Workstreams at the June session under our existing ADP agenda, as agreed here at this session. Co-Chairs, The opening of the technical expert groups under Workstream 2 this week provided a new opportunity to focus our discussions on the many opportunities available to enhance mitigation ambition in the short-term. We heard about some of the exciting steps countries are already taking in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency. These success stories demonstrate that the solutions to climate change are well within reach. This progress and emerging policy options should be captured in an update of our technical paper, and inform the ministerial discussions in June, in turn paving the way to the ramping up of ambition and the announcement of bold new initiatives and actions at the UN Secretary-General\\'s Summit in September. Co-Chairs, We were also able to deepen our discussions about the 2015 agreement under Workstream 1. As we emphasized repeatedly this week the level of ambition for the 2015 agreement, in light of the most recent science, is absolutely critical to our group. Our members are already suffering severe climate impacts, including devastating king tides that struck the Marshall Islands just last week and recent droughts in the Caribbean, which severely impacted Saint Lucia, Dominica, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines. These impacts have resulted in millions of dollars of damage to our small economies. Our response must be driven by a real sense of urgency. With this in mind, we would like to see the June session focus on the following areas:  A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the final 2015 agreement; Rapid progress on identifying the information parties need to present with their nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates better clarity, transparency, and a clearer understanding of the proposed commitments; And Agreement on a robust and transparent process to assess and review the adequacy and fairness of proposed commitments against the long-term global goal of holding warming below 1.5C, before the commitments are inscribed in the new legally-binding agreement. In addition, the 2015 agreement MUST contain adequate provision for long term, scaled up, predictable, new and additional finance to support adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change. This should complement the necessary transfer of technology and provisions for capacity building. Co-Chairs, Loss and Damage must be a separate element to be reflected under the new agreement. It should form a separate area of negotiation and warrants specific discussion in a separate session. The establishment of an International Mechanism to address Loss and Damage in Warsaw represents an important step and while our work continues there, addressing loss and damage is a reality for AOSIS and must be part of the 2015 agreement. The Warsaw International Mechanism must also be anchored in the new agreement. There is much work to accomplish in a very short period of time, so as we have said previously, holding an additional meeting in October will be critical to ensure continued progress on these priority areas in both Workstreams, and to fulfill the mandates we have from the COP. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you, Mr. Co-Chair. It is my pleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group. We are looking back on an intense week of negotiations and Technical Expert Meetings. We have covered both Work Streams, fostering the mutual understanding of our positions and of the potential for increased action on climate change. The Technical Expert Meetings, with a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energies, have allowed putting forward concepts, strategies and specific projects to raise pre-2020 ambition. We thank all facilitators and panelists, as well as all the participants for their active engagement. We look forward to continuing on this important path at the next session of the ADP this coming June. Sharing our experiences and the important lessons we have learnt is crucial to combat climate change, and this already in the short run.This past week has equally been markedly shaped by the negotiations on WorkStream 1: The EIG continues to greatly value the leadership of you, the ADP CoChairs, in this important process. We also value the active contribution of all the Parties and their negotiation groups. The EIG member countries believe that we leave Bonn with a yet better understanding of our mutual visions, and with the assurance that we have achieved progress in developing the elements of the 2015 Agreement. This past week, the EIG has put forward its specific views and positions in the various sessions dedicated to particular topics - and we want to refrain from reiterating them here. We just like to briefly refer to the discussions on some of the transversal issues we had yesterday. While we expect to delve more into these matters at the next sessions, we just like to make a very few points: The EIG believes that the cross-cutting or transversal issues should include some fundamentals and principles, including ensuring that the 2015 agreement does not exacerbate social inequalities or environmental degradation of any kind. In dealing with environmental issues, we should be aware that this must inherently also address current disparities. Parallel to our efforts, the Human Rights Council is closely looking into the relationship between Human Rights and Climate Change. It is important that our work takes these concerns fully into account, as we have done earlier in the Cancun Agreements. EIG member countries are committed to further integrate gender in the realm of climate change negotiations. Indeed, climate change impacts affect us all. However, due to their varying social roles and livelihood activities, impacts of climate change on women and men often differ. Therefore, it is important to address the gender-aspect of climate change and to take the specific perspectives and needs of women and men duly into account. The correlation between gender and development or between gender gap and development gap have already been proven, so gender equality 2 ADP Bonn March 2014 - Final Statement by EIG should be a fundamental principle of the 2015 Agreement to ensure effective global actions that trigger mitigation, adaptation and the provision of means of implementation. In this regard, gender equality should be part of the overall principles to guide the instrumentation of actions to follow. To end, the EIG wishes to thank you, the Co-Chairs, all other delegations as well as the representatives of civil society for their support and willingness to engage in fruitful discussions this past week. We also wish to thank the Secretariat for the continued support. We highly appreciate your efforts around the clock. And last, we do not want to forget the hospitality of the host country and of the city of Bonn. We always feel welcome here and we look forward to seeing you all again in a few months. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has the honour of delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) in Climate Change. We fully associate ourselves with the statement delivered by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chairs, We all learned in Bonn that any process of multilateral negotiation must be guided by the Parties and that mutual trust is important in order to move forward this process. The open-ended consultations that you put us through this week, rather than actually starting formal and structured negotiations among the Parties, have called for the exercise of patience, forbearance and understanding. We have actively participated and carefully listened these exchanges of information this week. However, the time for these exchanges is past and progress is now needed. We have to move forward. The urgency of the situation demands it. The future of our peoples, all over the world, requires it. Co-Chairs, We cannot afford to waste either time or money, in our meetings, particularly when every day millions of people in our developing countries continue to be highly affected by climate change impacts. We must now truly negotiate. We must now make use of the little time left for us to have concrete deliverables for Lima, on the road to Paris. Only the formal and structured negotiation through the Contact Group can help us make progress towards the elements for a draft negotiating text in Lima and achieve a successful, balanced and comprehensive agreed outcome in Paris. We look forward to now doing our work in a structured and formal mode of work in the Contact Group that we have established at this session under the ADP, covering both workstreams and focusing on the elements. There must be a clear plan of work for the remaining meetings of the ADP up to COP20 in Lima that clearly outlines for the Parties the issues and topics to be negotiated in the Contact Group. It must provide for sufficient negotiating time to be equally distributed among all the six core elements for a draft negotiating text - mitigation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transiency of action and support. This plan of work must be communicated to Parties well in advance, so as to avoid procedural debates and to enable agreed direct negotiation. Co-Chairs. The modalities of work should allow Parties to put their textual proposals early on in the process on the table to be compiled and provide them the possibility to negotiate their way forward together to an outcome that has been collectively produced. All Parties know what they are doing in this process. We all know that what is at stake is no less than our ability today to provide for today\\'s generations and to create a better future for future generations. With such high stakes, it is our individual and collective duty to make sure that we responsibly negotiate with each other as Parties, in good faith, without fear or pressure, on the basis of equality, with full respect for national sovereignty, and in a fully transparent and participatory manner. We look to you, Co-Chairs, to help Parties undertake this kind of negotiations together. When we negotiate in this way, Co-Chairs, we ensure that the results at COP20 and the agreed outcome at COP21 will, in fact, be collectively produced and agreed to by the Parties. This is fundamental to the integrity, credibility, and legitimacy of the outcome. Because we own it, we will implement it. Only in this way can success be achieved at Lima and Paris. Any other outcome produced in any other manner will not be acceptable. As had been expressed by the Philippines during this week, we would much rather have a comprehensive and balanced text thoroughly negotiated that we own as the agreed outcome, rather than a short text hurriedly negotiated that we do not own. The work under workstream 2 is not just about mitigation. The pre-2020 ambition also includes in addition to mitigation, the Bali Action Pan pillars of adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building as well. Hence, there needs to be a comprehensive and balanced treatment of all these issues as well in Worksteam 2, which must be addressed in a formal way in the ADP process. Co-Chairs, The LMDC continues to be committed, together with other members of the Group of 77 and China, with the help of civil society and the public, to produce by COP21 in Paris a balanced, comprehensive, and equitable agreed outcome, under the Convention and reflecting its principles and provisions, and which allows us to achieve the objective of the Convention together. This must be an outcome that will create a better future, a better world, for our countries and our peoples, particularly those of us living in developing countries. It must be an outcome that enables us to effectively combat climate change and its adverse effects in an equitable manner under the Convention and to achieve sustainable development. Towards this objective, Co-Chairs, you can count on the continued active, constructive, progressive, and positive engagement and involvement of the developing countries in the LMDC in these negotiations. Finally, Co-Chairs, on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as well as the LMDC, I look forward to welcoming all of you to the first-ever \"\"Social Pre-COP\"\" that will be held in Caracas this November with a preparatory international meeting in July. This \"\"Social Pre-COP\"\" will enable social movements and civil society organizations to come together and interact, make their voices heard, and provide their valuable inputs from the grassroots into this process. Thank you, Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"The Dominican Republic has the honor of speaking at representation of the Central American Integration System (SICA), while we adhere to the declaration presented by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. The Member States of the Integration System Central American (SICA), we attended the negotiations in the framework of the ADP maintaining our commitment and we insist that develop in a transparent, participatory, open and inclusive way, respecting the principles and objectives of the Convention, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The SICA countries highlight our regional status highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which every year generate serious consequences and negative impacts for our life and development, as recognized in the recent report on extreme events presented by the IPCC. These effects represent a serious threat to the food security of the population, direct impact on socio-economic dynamics, public finances of the countries of the region and our competitiveness countries, year after year, we are forced to divert resources financial that we need for the eradication of poverty, the sustainable development, and to make viable what we recognize today as urgent and forced adaptation. We ratify our disposition before the international community in promoting national actions to reduce vulnerability and the search and implementation of an effective adaptation under the principles of the Convention. We make an urgent appeal to all the Parties and especially to the developed countries, to establish commitments and concrete actions to address the existing pre-2020 ambition gap and especially, how to address financial support, training and access to technology to promote these actions in our towns. We also reiterate our commitment to work jointly with all the Parties, by a binding agreement in 2015, according to the Durban Platform in 1 / CP 17, in accordance with principles and objectives of the Convention towards the goal of a 2C and even bring it up to 1.5C levels, following the guidelines dictated by science. We consider it indispensable and opportune to discussions next June in a more formal and structured way. For this we support the formation of a contact group that address (Workstream 1 and WS 2). And that a clear and balanced work program for this contact group that covers all meetings from June until the closing of COP 20 in Lima. We return to our countries to continue the work and resume our negotiations in this same city next June, to continue contributing our work to build the elements of the Agreement to be signed at COP21. Dear Co-Chairs, We reiterate our call to developed countries to comply with the financing and support commitments acquired under the Convention and we urge that the commitment for the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund, continue our long-term financing negotiations and guarantee their implementation underway in order to meet the most urgent needs of developing countries, guaranteeing the equitable distribution of these resources between adaptation and mitigation. The SICA countries, we express our commitment and availability to continue working to lay the foundations for a ambitious, durable and effective 2015 agreement, which should reflect the balance of all the elements and adaptation actions and mitigation and being flexible with our different circumstances nationals. The SICA countries, we recognize the importance of celebrating the Second Dialogue of Art.6 on Education to be held this year having as central theme Public Participation in the taking of decisions and climate change initiatives. We reiterate that without educated citizens we cannot achieve sustainable development. Finally, Co-Presidents, we want to ratify our solidarity with all those countries that are experiencing negative consequences of the adverse effects of climate change and who have the urgency and the need to obtain concrete commitments and effective as soon as possible in the negotiations international climate. Our populations cannot continue waiting. Thank you so much.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, The work we have developed this week has generated important inputs for the process of negotiation and will contribute to its progress. This session had offered an opportunity to engage all the Parties in a process of sharing visions, information, policies and technical experiences applied on the ground; allowing us to have a better understanding of different issues. The outputs are useful to identify areas of common understanding. This exercise allows us to further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text by Lima in a formal negotiating mode. We understand the need to work under the formalities and applied rules of procedure as are established under the Convention, we believe that we should not lose sight of the urgency of accelerating the process in which we are. We have a duty to deliver a document that sends the world a message that this process is contributing to build agreements in order to protect the climate system, the mankind and the mother earth. The Group called for a more structured and formal mode of negotiations that would enhance the participation of the Parties in further elaborating elements for a draft negotiating text toward achieving the concrete outcomes mandated by the COP17, COP18 and COP19. In doing so, the Group sought to prioritize the work that needs to be completed by Lima, while making progress towards finalizing the text of the future agreement in time for adoption in Paris. Pursuant to Decision 1/CP.19 adopted at Warsaw, the members of the Group of 77 and China committed themselves to progressing the work at the June session of the ADP to further elaborate elements for a draft negotiating text; including, inter alia; on mitigation, adaptation, loss & damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support. We welcome the establishment of a Contact Group and moving to a formal Party-driven process. We request the Co-Chairs to facilitate the process and to present a scenario note with a clear plan of work for the June session and the subsequent sessions for 2014, and the Group considers this essential to move forward and make progress quickly. Mr. Co-Chairs, As before the Group continues to stress that outcomes must be guided by the provisions and the principles of the UNFCCC and be balanced and legitimate to all Parties, and further stresses that the process should be designed and conducted in a manner that inspires confidence. Co-Chairs, We believe it will be important to have a session in October, before the COP 20, and to advance in June, making as much progress as possible, so that we can guarantee the session to take place before the COP in Lima. Mr. Co-Chairs, We enter this phase of our discussions to negotiate in good faith, and will work under your able facilitation, towards an outcome that will serve all our interests in a balanced manner. The Group expresses to you our support for that purpose. The members of the Group of 77 and China are of the view that the outcome of our work under the Durban Platform must enable us to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. It should strengthen the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention in order to achieve its ultimate objective. In this regard, the Group of 77 and Chi.na express our committed to continue our work in the June session of the ADP with a view to delivering the mandated elements for a draft negotiating text in Lima. Thank you very much.\"',\n",
              "       '\"This is a statement on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. I am delivering this statement on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member State. Dear co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends We have this week worked on substance in relation to both workstreams under our agenda. In the context of our work on the 2015 Agreement, we have had a rich discussion on what Parties consider as important in relation to achieving effective adaptation and climate resilience. We will need to further deepen our understanding on how adaptation can best be reflected in the final agreement. We have also had a good and substantial debate on climate finance. In our discussions on this issue this year it will be important to keep focus on how to transform all financial flows such that we can move towards low carbon climate resilient societies. It is also important to emphasise that the EU has, is and will continue to deliver climate finance. In our discussions on mitigation we have heard that all Parties must act in order to achieve the below 2\\'C objective. Furthermore we have heard that all Parties must act in accordance with national circumstances, and evolving responsibilities and capabilities. The EU supports these views. Future global efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases must be enhanced from current levels and by all Parties in a way that is fair and ambitious. In that context many Parties have mentioned the need to have an international process to consider, before COP 21, the aggregate level of ambition represented by intended nationally determined mitigation contributions in order to ensure that we stay on track for our below 2\\'C objective. In order to do so, we need to have clarity around Parties\\' intended mitigation contributions. In that context it is encouraging to note the wide call from across the negotiations to identify - as agreed - up front information requirements by Lima. This is vital in order to ensure that proposed contributions are transparent, quantifiable, comparable, verifiable and ambitious. A number of Parties - developed and developing - elaborated on constructive proposals for what this means in practice. A priority for June must be to make further progress on this. We have also heard further elaboration from developed and developing countries for what the rules base - in particular MRV and accounting - could look like in the 2015 Agreement, in the context of a variety of possible mitigation commitment types. Such a rules base is critical to ensuring that the below 2\\'C objective is achieved. Making further progress on this must be also be a priority for June. All Parties agree that the work and outcome of the ADP is and will be under the Convention, including its principles. Going forward we need to consider more deeply how this can be operationalised in a practical manner and in relation to all elements of our work towards the 2015 Agreement. Enhancing pre 2020 mitigation ambition by all Parties is also a crucial part of our work. We are encouraged by the positive and constructive manner in which all Parties have engaged in the Technical Expert Meetings on renewables and energy efficiency. We have heard appetite for cooperation between Parties. The energy sector is an area with enormous, cost-effective mitigation potential, which can best be realised if we work together to exploit opportunities and overcome the barriers. We found the technical expert meetings to be a very helpful mode of work ? and one that can yield genuine results. We expect that the summaries of our rich discussions, and the lists of policy options, will be captured through the Chairs?? summaries or reflections, and used as an input to the Secretariat technical paper. We look forward to the continuation of the technical expert meetings in June - and we have outlined a number of ways in which this could be done. We encourage the Secretariat to assist Parties in their preparations by making the agenda available well in advance of the June session. We would expect to continue our discussions on the energy sector, and would also \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. Allow me at the outset to express our appreciation to the Government of Germany for hosting this meeting, and for the Convention\\'s Secretariat for its excellent arrangements. The African Group associates itself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group 77 and China. The African Group would like to thank the Co-Chairs for the guidance provided on how they intend to proceed with the 5th part of the 2nd session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, the ADP 2. As has been the practice, the Co-chairs hold pre-sessional consultations with various Groups to further shape the organisation of work in the session, and it is of great concern that the Group hasn\\'t had the benefit of such a consultation, particularly in such an important session where our Ministers will also be present 3. The Group has concerns on a number of issues, and we believe clarity and resolution of those issues is indispensable prior to the contact group commencing with its work, as Parties must have a common understanding of what will be the outcome of this session. It is our understanding that the work of the ADP under work stream I has two major tasks, the first being work towards a decision in Lima, capturing the 1 elements of the draft negotiating text, and a decision capturing the information and format Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions 5. Co~Chairs1 inn working towards elements of the negotiating text, we would like to bring the following to your attention: We need to have a clearer view of how the work will be organised for the entire year, including the additional session in October, and this is important taking into account the limited amount of time we have before Lima. We would like to bring to your attention that we clearly made that call to you in the March 2014 session of the ADP. The reflection note, specifically the \\'landscape of issues identified by Parties\\' is a fair attempt to reflect the views expressed by Parties1 however it has some short comings, such as: On how it reflects ideas communicated by Parties which in some instances are not a reflection of the ideas in their entirety as presented by Parties. Furthermore it doesn\\'t have the benefit of all submissions made by Parties specifically on what they see as elements of 2015 Agreement which may have come through after the publication of the reflection note. It conflates the two processes under the ADP, namely, arriving at elements of the negotiation text1 and information Parties will put forward when putting forward their contributions, It contains some elements that are not in conformity with the principles and provisions of the Convention, which is the overarching legal framework under which we are negotiating. On working towards information Parties will provide when communicating their intended nationally determined contributions, the African Group would like to share the following observations, We are concerned about the time available for Parties to meet the March 2015 deadline, given that the decision on information to be provided by Parties will only be adopted in Lima. We however see an opportunity for 2 the outcome of this session to be a draft conclusion that can provide guidance to Parties on how to proceed with the national processes b. We note the oversight by the Co-chairs in consistently referring to nationally determined contributions in the scenario note1 whereas the precise language from Warsaw is of intended nationally determined contributions\\', and wish to put it on record that such an oversight severely prejudices the African Group position that such contributions are subject to a multilateral assessment for fairness and adequacy. The African Group further wish to express concern over scope, and focus of the work undertaken by some organisations in the context of paragraph 2d of decision 1/CP.19. Our experience in Africa is that the regional workshop by UNDP focussed on mitigation, and did not address the core basis of the mandate, which is provision of financial; support. Our understanding as the African Group is that, the scope of this work also includes adaptation, finance, and technology contributions. We are of the view that further guidance is necessary for such important initiatives, to avoid prejudice to positions of other Parties. Understanding that contributions from developed countries should also include provision of finance and technology transfer and capacity building by developed countries to developing countries, sequencing is of utmost importance, where there is early clarity on means of implementation to be provided by developed countries as this is key information for developing countries to communicate meaningful intended national determined contributions. It is also important to reach an early agreement on the process of communication of the contributions. Lastly Co-chairs, we understand that the stock-taking meeting referred to in para 28 of the scenario note will include the work undertaken under Workstream I of 3 the ADP, and we see the stock-taking meeting as a critical stage in this session to start working on the conclusions of this session. With regards to Workstream II, the Group welcomes your suggestion for a COP decision in Lima and sees it as an opportunity to further strengthen our work, its modalities, arrangements and process, through the following: a. Broaden the scope of activities beyond TEMs as reflected in para 4 of Decision 1/CP.19 as to include concrete proposals such as (i) the transformation of the CDM Pipeline into net mitigation projects or (ii) the expansion of national REFiTs schemes, Ensure this week KP and ADP ministerial roundtables outcomes and recommendations on Pre-2020 Ambition are followed-up accordingly under the Workstream, Assess the extent and effectiveness of the accelerated implementation of decisions constituting the agreed outcome under the Bali Action Plan, in particular in relation to the provisions of means of implementation as per para 3 of Decision 1/CP.19, for appropriate further actions 10. Furthermore, after a careful review of the rich content of the technical paper on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency; we are convinced of the necessity to go a step beyond technical examinations and elaboration of policy briefs, to the matching of the technical outputs with adequate support and support channels, for effective implementation. Co-chairs, The African Group stands ready to engage in the session in an open and constructive manner and to move the ADP towards achieving its mandate for this year, which is to reach an agreement on the elements of a negotiation text for the 2015 agreement. I thank you\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Co-Chairs. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the AILAC group of countries. At the outset, l would like to associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chairs. Allow me to express AILAC\\'s appreciation for your considerable effort in the preparation of the Landscape of Issues identified by Parties, which contains a comprehensive recollection of the multiple elements that have been discussed under the ADP\\'s deliberations up until today. This Landscape will help us as a useful tool to move forward in the deliberations of the ADP Contact Group. It meets the three fundamental principles we have agreed: a partydriven process, based upon the inputs of Parties, and with outputs that reflect such inputs. This is the type of work that we expect from you and we consider it to be an adequate starting point for our deliberations. We most assuredly reiterate our support to your guidance under this approach, and look forward to progressive outcomes from our deliberations that capture, as you have done so far, the will and inputs from the Parties. AILAC acknowledges the fact that, given that the Landscape recalls all of the issues and elements brought forward by the Parties under the ADP\\'s deliberations, it presents divergent views on a number of topics. Others, clearly present groundwork for building consensus in hopes of arriving at common grounds and concepts that enable the result of a draft text at the next COP in Lima. Yet, we must highlight that in this exercise there is still an imbalance in the way some issues are presented, since some points provide for a clear narrative to enable their understanding, whereas others are presented on a short schematic approach that seems somewhat disorganized and disarticulated with regards to other elements presented. This of course is part the work that the Parties must engage in in the next days. Co-Chairs, AILAC is unequivocally committed to engage in a constructive discussion with all Parties and stakeholders under the ADP on this basis, without prejudice to the final outcome and its legal form, so as to achieve significant progress in this session and ensure that we arrive at a coherent draft text to be adopted in Lima that in turn enables the adoption of an agreement in Paris on 2015. Co-Chairs, As the Lima COP approaches, we are conscious of the urgent need to intensify our work. Back in March, as we closed our previous meeting, AILAC identified two main challenges for the way ahead: First, engaging in a contact group setting requires that Parties have a strong sense of trust and ownership over what we are working on, and at the same time that we are able to deliver through an efficient and rationalized mode of work, under the able guidance of the Co-Chairs. Second, we still need to identify the elements that will allow us to gather momentum under work-stream 2, going from the initial technical phase, towards a political one where we can have a significant impact on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation actions. As we start these two intense weeks, we have the expectation that we will face these challenges and progress decisively towards COP 20. For this, Co-Chairs, we consider it is fundamental that at this session, we continue engaging constructively on further exploring all the elements that the future legally binding agreement must include. AILAC reiterates the need for those elements to highlight our common global goals and objectives that define a long term vision on each of the main elements of the agreement, as well as the general guiding provisions that will serve as a basis for the future agreement. The 2015 agreement must also set forth clearly the way by which each country will contribute to achieve those global goals. ln this regard we have coined in Warsaw the concept of the iNDCs. In April, UNDP and the Government of Colombia held the First Technical Dialogue on iNDCS in Bogota, with the objective of discussing amongst Latin-American countries the scope and the challenges in preparing this contributions. Discussion were indeed productive in particular in regards to the underlying technical basis required to prepare robust, realistic and achievable contributions; as well in the identification of support needs required to reach domestic agreement and follow-up actions in this regard. With this broad conceptual structure in mind, where for each element we craft a global goal accompanied by what all Parties will do to contribute towards its achievement, AILAC looks forward to further developing the elements of the 2015 agreement. AILAC stands AILAC ready to work with all parties, and under the able guidance of our distinguished Co-Chairs, to further develop our collective clarity of the concepts that appear in the Landscape. We are confident that working together will bring us to a renewed global response to climate change. Our collective aim is to achieve a workabfe and coherent draft negotiating text by the end of this year. For this purpose it is imperative that Parties work together to promptly define the elements of the agreement, In parallel, as mandated by COP 19, it is crucial to focus in the preparation of the Lima decision on the information that should accompany NDC, in order to facilitate the understanding and comparability of Parties\\' contributions. These two should be our priorities here in Bonn. Finally, we would like to highlight the crucial importance that workstream 2 has for AlLAC. We know that additional efforts are needed this decade, if we are to achieve our common objective of avoiding temperature rise above 22c. Efforts and actions undertaken today will be significant savings for the future- this must be always kept in mind. Workstream 2 must contribute to the implementation more ambitious actions in the immediate future and to catalyze a significant increase in investment in climate change in the years between now and 2020. There is an important link between the pre 2020 definition of mitigation ambition, and the clarity and predictability in the pathway to increase the provision of financial resources between now and 2020. This link must not be overseen. In this context, the urgent and significant capitalization of the GCF plays a pivotal role. We were very encouraged by the results of the last GCF Board meeting in Songdo, and are looking forward to see the fund capitalized in the next months, with a very substantial initial capitalization amount; we expect the Fund to be ready to start disbursing resources by the Lima COP. Along with this effort, we must find specific ways in which workstream 2 can contribute to deliver ambitious results on the ground. The technical phase of our work has been useful and necessary; yet, it is time to clearly link this work with political decision-making and concrete mitigation action. We must bear in mind that the potential success of the mitigation component under workstream 1, will build upon the foundations of our pre2020 work. These foundations need to be strong, robust, well designed and appropriately built, so that the architecture of the future agreement can be ambitious, visionary, and built for delivering long term results. Co-Chairs, what fies ahead of us is no easy task. We stand ready to work together with all Parties, under your able guidance, to achieve ambitious results. We fully trust you to guide us through this journey, for which you have all our support, and can count on us for moving ahead decisively and boldly. This however cannot be achieved without the commitment of all of us to work together. This is why, through you Co-Chairs, AILAC also would like to express that we fully trust all of our negotiating partners, we count on al! of them, and we will be reinforcing our efforts to reach out to all of them, in order to move forward together towards the results that we all need to achieve during the next weeks and months. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. President. Climate Change negotiations. they are at a critical point. Since the approval of the Durban Platform in 2011, intensified attacks on the principles and provisions of the Convention. It is intended to generate new arrangements that delete the differences in terms of different country responsibilities developed and developing, and therefore of the commitment that the former have in terms of mitigation, adaptation and compensation for loss and damage; along with financing, technology transfer and capacity building. These commitments were accepted by signing the Convention in 1992 and ratify its principles in Rio in 2012. At the same time The aim is to promote market mechanisms, whose operability, effectiveness and ethical bases are strongly questioned, as a way out of the permanence of the effects of economic and financial crisis and maintaining the hegemony of the currently dominant groups, by legitimizing the law to pollute for those who can pay it and the commodification of the nature and human beings. We can allow this to happen and there is no time to waste. We all live on the same planet, we are part of it ecosystem and we are threatened by imbalances that our same species has generated. All human beings are threatened by the climate catastrophe that is just beginning, but not all in the same way. Nor are our responsibilities the same. The truth is clear and simple: Developed countries have generated this crisis but developing countries and their populations are poor and vulnerable, those who suffer it most intensely and they are at greater risk. This simple truth, integrated into the principles of the Convention, it cannot be ignored. As if that were not enough, ironically, it is the developing countries that have brought more emission reductions to date emissions There is no solution without justice. It is worrying and sadly diagnostic that the Green Fund of the Climate has not already received significant contributions from the countries developed. The same secretary of the United Nations described it in Warsaw as an \"\"empty shell\"\". It has even been reached end of proposing that it be managed by the private sector, through from private banking. Mr. President. Given the urgency of the crisis we want to establish some lines bases of what must be that agreement that we hope with all our strength to achieve in 2015. It is worrying that the legal regime established by the Convention and his Kyoto Pro Tocolo seems to be blurring and blurring in ADP discussions , which could create a legal vacuum regarding the legal guarantees that the community has for the implementation of the Convention. Thus , Any future agreement must continue with what has been achieved until now and strengthen it. We need our legal experts work on this subject as one of the central themes of discussion. The Principles of the Convention they must be respected, we need clear rules to ensure that this is the case, not ambiguous statements with multiple interpretations. These principles establish a differentiation of countries by their historical responsibilities, this it must be clearly reflected in the provisions of the agreement. All commitments must be measured, reported and verified, including the commitments of developed countries in the provision of financing, technology and construction of capacities. Adaptation and mitigation are equally important and should be represented in equal measure. It is the peoples, represented by their governments, who have the duty and responsibility to mediate and balance the interests of different actors who make life within your countries. It is neither possible nor acceptable to delegate State responsibilities to the private sector. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a country-led climate con ference, not a round of business focused exclusively on new mechanisms of market or a lobby for private companies. Mr president Time is short, we spend hours, days, weeks turning around euphemisms and conventions without attacking the issues crucial. Peoples suffer and tire, mother earth does not wait. We are nearing the end of a negotiation cycle, fears and hopes intensify but a question haunts us: The Protocol Kyoto has had huge failures stemming from inaction and default of developed countries. The second period of Kyoto commitment, with its notable shortcomings and not yet ratified by enough countries for it to enter into force barely represents the 15% of global emissions. No instrument can succeed before such a lack of commitments, what will be different now? We know what is at stake, Mr. President. ALBA once manifests more to you and to the world, our unwavering commitment to the climatic health of the planet. We are ready to put body and soul into this task, but we are equally committed to our principles, our political processes and our history, to fight tirelessly for the sovereignty, equity, justice and well-being for all peoples. Forgetting the past is making yourself complicit in the injustices of the present. There is not nor can there ever be a solution without justice. THANKS A LOT \"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China as well as Nepal on behalf of the LDCs and Sudan on behalf of the African Group. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for your continued hard work and assure you of our full trust and confidence in your leadership as we move forward in this crucial process. The recent contributions of the IPCC Working Groups 2 and 3 to the Fifth Assessment Report underscore that Small Island Developing States are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events. Given the urgency of the task at hand, we hope to avoid squandering precious time haggling over procedural issues here and feel strongly that a single contact group is the most effective way for us to proceed. Co-Chairs, Regarding pre-2020 mitigation ambition, we recognize the need for political discussion on paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. It is incumbent on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change by raising the ambition of their 2020 commitments, and with regard to KP parties, ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. In addition, we must fully implement the Bali Action Plan, particularly through immediate action by developed countries to enhance the delivery of finance, technology transfer and development, and capacity building. AOSIS is of the view that the technical expert meetings under Workstream 2 can be a means to achieving these objectives. The discussions during the technical expert meetings under Workstream 2 in March, where parties shared their success stories deploying renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, demonstrated that the solutions to climate change are well within reach. We welcome the updated Technical Paper on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, which we found to be very comprehensive and useful and we look forward to additional TEMs, including a second meeting this year on renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as on other policy areas with high mitigation potential and important cobenefits. Our challenge must be continually moving these technical discussions toward ways we can work together to mobilize solutions. We look forward to the Technical Expert Meetings on land use and cities during this session, and we hope to have another meeting on renewable energy and energy efficiency. We also hope intensify our support for the Workstream 2 process, and we encourage more developed countries to come forward with their plans to enhance short-term ambition. We also welcome the engagement by ministers at this meeting and hope that the new focus on proven climate solutions under this process helps pave the way to increased ambition and ultimately closing the emissions gap. Co-Chairs, We were also able to deepen our discussions about the 2015 agreement under Workstream 1 in March. In light of the latest science about sea level rise and other worsening climate impacts, the level of ambition is absolutely critical to our group. Our response must therefore be driven by a real sense of urgency. With this in mind we would like to see this session focus on the following areas: First, A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the final 2015 agreement; and Second, Identification of the information needed to allow parties to present their intended nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates clarity, transparency, and an understanding. Additionally, finance is an integral building block of the 2015 agreement. The 2015 agreement MUST contain commitments by developed country Parties and provisions to ensure scaled-up, adequate long term, predictable, new and additional finance to support mitigation and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries. This should complement other necessary means of implementation including transfer of technology and capacity building. AOSIS expects the new agreement to address the gaps of the current climate finance architecture and flows, including the shortage of funding for concrete adaptation in most vulnerable countries and the barriers to access resources for those capacity-constrained countries. Both public and private flows towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development have to be scaled up urgently and different types of financing should be used and prioritized for different activities. Developed countries will have the same obligations to provide support under the new agreement as they have under the Convention and they should take the lead in scaling-up climate finance. Also, as mandated by the decision 1/CP17, the outcome of the 2013-2015 Review should inform ambition under the new agreement, thus we would like to see the Chairs of the Structured Expert Dialogue regularly report to the ADP on progress being made. Co-Chairs, Loss and damage due to the impacts of climate change is a reality for AOSIS and it must therefore be part of the 2015 agreement. Loss and Damage must be a separate element under the new agreement. The establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism to address Loss and Damage represents an important step and while our work there continues, it must also be anchored in the new agreement. There is much work to accomplish in a very short period of time, but we are optimistic that if we work with a shared sense of purpose and urgency we can make substantial progress on these priority areas in both Workstreams, and fulfill the mandate we have from the COP. As always, we assure you of our support as we continue to make progress in this critical area. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs. I have the honour to speak on behalf of BASIC. We wish to associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. First of all, we would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of the Co-Chairs in facilitating the ADP negotiation process thus far and in particular for your reflections note on the discussions during the March ADP session, which we think helps to give Parties a useful information and good overview of the landscape of issues. We assure you of our continued support and cooperation in the ADP negotiations this year. We have already done a lot of work in the ADP and Parties\\' have a much clearer picture of each others\\' expectations and interests. The time left for us to finalise the 2015 agreement and achieve a concrete and meaningful outcome on pre-2020 ambition is, however, very limited. We are therefore pleased to start this session in a contact group setting to work through the balanced, focused and formal mode of negotiation. Co-Chairs. It is important at the outset to remind ourselves that the Durban Platform is to further enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. This means that the 2015 agreement must strengthen the multilateral rules-based system under the Convention. To achieve this, the outcome of our work under both Workstreams must be science-based, ambitious and equitable. It ls by no means to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or reinterpret the Convention or its principles, provisions and Annexes. The ADP Warsaw Decision further reiterates that the Durban Platform is under the Convention and shall be guided by the principles of the Convention, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. This was also clear in our decisions from Durban and Doha. The 2015 agreement must therefore adhere to the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the provisions of Articles 4 and 12, which reflect the common but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries. Decision 1/CP.19 has given us a clear set of tasks for 2014: We need to further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text, and identify by Lima, the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their intended nationally determined contributions. The 2015 agreement should address all elements referred to in paragraph 5 of Decision 1 /CP .17, i.e. mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building and transparency of action and support, in a balanced and comprehensive manner, and should not just be confined to mitigation. ln accordance with the Durban mandate, we further mapped out our work in Warsaw and decided that Parties\\' intended nationally determined contributions must cover mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed country Parties to developing countries. The Warsaw ADP decision also invited all Parties to initiate and intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions. However, with regard to the intended nationally determined contributions, it is important to understand that contributions should cover all the pillars of the Convention and be in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular the Article 4 of the Convention. We call on developed countries in particular to include in their submissions of contributions and information on the provision of finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries in addition to their mitigation commitments. Developing country Parties\\' contributions will be in the context of sustainable development, and dependent on the financial and technological support provided by developed country Parties. We also believe that information to facilitate the understanding and transparency of the contributions shall be differentiated between developed and developing countries. Co-Chairs. With regard to pre-2020 ambition, we must address mitigation, adaptation and finance and technology support. We urge developed country Parties participating in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to revisit and significantly increase their emission reduction targets in 2014. We also urge developed countries that are not part of the second commitment period to also significantly raise the ambition of their commitments under the Convention within the same timeframe and in a comparable manner. We also urge those Annex I Parties that have not put forward a 2020 pledge to do so. Developed countries should also honour and fulfill their commitments on the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries during the preM2020 period. And we look forward to the Ministerial Roundtabte and Dialogue on these issues above. We will continue our engagements and participations in the Technical Expert Meetings. However, Workstream II should not be downgraded to the TEMs on few selective sectors. It is fundamental for Workstream II to focus on dealing with crucial issues related to revisiting and increasing the comparable emission reduction targets by all developed country Parties under the second commitment period of the KP or under the Convention and enhancing provision of finance, technology and capacity building by developed country Parties to developing country Parties. Paragraph 3 and 4 of decision 1/CP.19 are an integral and essential part of the work under Workstream II. These two paragraphs should be seriously discussed under the Contact Group as a matter of urgency, with a view to achieving a balanced and comprehensive outcome on implementing the workplan of pre-2020 ambition in Lima. We are concerned that the mitigation effort by developing country Parties is currently much greater than that by developed countries. As developing countries we are ready to undertake our enhanced action to address climate change. Our concern however is that developed countries have not shown sufficient ambition, despite their historical responsibility and greater access to the means of implementation. It is simply not acceptable that the commitments of developed countries should be transferred to developing countries. We nevertheless commend the wide array of climate initiatives that are pursued outside the Convention and we recognize that these international cooperative initiatives may help us to combat climate change. These initiatives must however be treated in full accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention and must not distract us here in our efforts to address the challenge of climate change multilaterally under the Convention. However, 2 of these initiatives can\\'t substitute for the core actions required under the Kyoto Protocol and its revisit. We would like to reiterate our full commitment and support to you in facilitating the ADP process forward, with a view to making balanced and comprehensive progress in an open and transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-building manner. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We believe the 2015 agreement should be based on the elaboration of all 6 core elements identified in decision 1/CP.17: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building. On mitigation, the new agreement should tal(e into account the latest scientific information with the global commitment to be set at a level that would maintain global temperature in accordance with a 1,5 C degree global goal. While the agreement should be applicable to all, the principles of the Convention should be respected and leadership from developed countries guide us in the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. The nature of nationally determined contributions to be presented by all Parties should be differentiated. The 2015 agreement should be adequately informed by the work of other subsidiary bodies under the Convention and build upon important results achieved through past COP decisions. On mitigation, the new agreement should tl1erefore include, among its key elements, a REDD+ mechanism to be fully supported by a broad variety of financing sources, primarily from developed country Parties. The Warsaw REDD+ Framework should serve as the foundation of such a mechanism. Mr Co-Chair, we are looking forward to engaging with all Parties during the Technical Expert Meetings this session, in particular on REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems. As identified by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the mitigation gap is greater than before and there is a clear need to increase mitigation ambition. Tropical deforestation and forest degradation represent the largest and most variable single contributor\\' to emissions from land-use change and this is why mitigation actions on REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems are within reach and can contribute significantly toward reducing that gap. Mr Co-Chair, we see four main objectives to be achieved in Lima under the ADP; The inclusion of REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems into a COP decision draft negotiating text, based on the supporting decisions of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework Capturing the results of the technical expert meetings in a COP decision so that concrete mitigation actions are identified to close tl1e ambition gap before 2020; Successfully launching the Warsaw REDD+ Framework as per decision 10/CP.19; The opening of a REDD+ window in the GCF Finally Mr Co-Chairs, We are looking forward to engaging with all Parties in the elaboration of the elements of the draft negotiating text to be delivered in Lima. We are confident that you will assist us in the completion of this challenging task.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, we all have heard the very clear message from the IPCC. Climate Change is a fundamental threat to humankind. But this threat can be prevented. The newest reports of the IPCC have also shown that we do have the scientific knowledge, the technological possibilities and the economic means to keep global temperature increase below 2?C. What is needed is to operationalize the political will which our ministers have expressed repeatedly. And this is why we are here, to work together to ensure that the ministers will have a sound basis for taking the needed decisions in Lima. Mr. Co-Chairs, ADP is entering its final stage: by 2015 we must adopt a legally binding instrument effective from 2020 onwards that must be a comprehensive response to the urgent challenge of climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and building on transparency. To this aim, the ADP - under its workstream 1 - must develop by the end of 2014 a clean draft negotiation text. The EIG agrees that the draft negotiation text should be construed collectively and be build upon the views expressed by Parties in submissions and in statements and in the negotiations. The best way to reflect all views is that you, Mr. Co-Chair, will prepare the draft text for negotiations. The EIG calls for a legally binding instrument with all Parties taking appropriate mitigation commitments which include clearly defined targets or actions, under the same rules but at different depths in terms of type of commitment, timing, and level of effort according to CBDR/RC and equity. In this regard, the ADP must adopt by COP20 in Lima the information that Parties are to submit along their intended nationally determined contributions well before COP21, in the first quarter of 2015 for those ready to do so. We must leave Bonn with a draft decision on this issue and allow sufficient time here in Bonn to deliver on this specific mandate from Warsaw. The instrument must also equally address adaptation: Adaptation is a fundamental challenge for all of us. We need a strong and effective framework that helps all countries, and especially the most vulnerable in need of support, to develop and implement effective adaptation policies. Support will similarly be important. The EIG welcomes the successful meeting of the Green Climate Fund Executive Board in Sondgo in Korea. An important step has been achieved, we have now to move rapidly to the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. [We are optimistic that at the first GCF meeting for the initial capitalization will successfully take place in a month time in the Swiss capital of Bern and that it will allow this new international finance instrument to be very soon fully operational. And we hope that the UN Climate Summit will be another important stepping stone towards the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund. Mr. Co-Chair. We have another very urgent matter to deal with: the pre-2020 ambition. In our view all parties should contribute to close the emissions gap in view of achieving the target to keep global warming below 2 degrees with respect to historic levels. Therefore, there is a need to for increased action within and outside the Convention. Here in Bonn we must further explore through the technical Expert Meetings opportunities for climate action. This technical work must build towards the high-level events later this year. By Lima we will have to capture progress in increased action and lay a solid foundation for further work. Finally, Mr Co-Chairs, the EIG appreciates your arrangements for efficient and focused work under the ADP. The Scenario note, the Reflection on the progress made and the Landscape of issues identified by Parties are outlining a positive, constructive and solution-oriented a\"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gives us hope - if we act collectively, urgently and at the global level we can achieve the below 2?C objective - and do so in a manner that promotes sustainable economic growth, as well as wider benefits such as improvement of health, air quality, water quality and energy security. This is what the ADP will be measured against. Decision 1/CP19 invited Parties to come forward with their national contributions well in advance of Paris and in the first quarter of 2015 for those Parties in a position to do so. It is essential that all Parties stick to the timetable that was agreed in Warsaw. We expect all major and emerging economies, as well as other Parties that are ready, to also come forward in early 2015. The EU will do so. Achieving the below 2?C objective will require deeper cuts in emissions from all Parties, with the major and emerging economies leading the way. We welcome the initiative of the Secretariat to facilitate the coordination of the support and capacity building that is available to Parties that need it to develop contributions, building on the workshop and briefing in the March session. Across the EU we are mobilising support and technical assistance through a number of bilateral and multilateral programmes and projects, and we are also encouraging and further supporting international organisations to do likewise. Decision 1/CP19 also specified that the upfront information requirements in relation to contributions must be agreed by COP20 at the latest. Drafting a decision on upfront information should be a focus of this session. The last months have seen a wealth of ideas that Parties have put forward on the draft elements of the 2015 Agreement. These have been captured in the co-Chairs\\' reflection note of the March session. We now need to have more detailed discussions on all the issues raised by Parties in order identify potential areas of convergence; to crystallise distinct options; and to set out areas of further work needed to move towards a succinct draft elements text by Lima. It is the duty of the co-Chairs to facilitate this Party driven process. In the March technical meeting on opportunities for action on renewable energy and energy efficiency, many shared best practice and ideas for further mitigation actions in line with economic and social priorities. Parties indicated tangible ways to raise ambition by 2020. We want to deepen this exchange and to look into further opportunities for action by 2020 through addressing urban challenges and land use. This discussion should be focused on enabling Parties and institutions to join up efforts towards scaling up action in areas of high mitigation potential, and to provide guidance to that effect. This technical work must feed concrete ideas into political processes. We need to identify the most efficient way to do so, for instance drawing a summary for policymakers out of the list of policy options identified in the technical process for Ministers to consider, and to engage Convention bodies and international organisations to facilitate action and implementation on the ground. Political leadership is essential to make progress in 2014, a year in which the UN Secretary-General will convene World Leaders to discuss climate change for the first time since 2009. We need highlevel guidance on progress towards the 2015 Agreement, as well as the policy packages and international initiatives that will unlock new opportunities for low-emission climate-resilient development before 2020. Some of this high-level guidance and leadership must result from the ministerial meetings we are convening tomorrow and the day after. This guidance and the work of the ADP should provide the context for the UN Secretary-General summit. The EU will this week show that we are implementing our pre-2020 commitments effect\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC has confirmed that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. As we begin the June session in a contact group setting, we are mindful of the little time remaining for Parties to complete our work. The Group believes that the work of this session needs to be formal, focused and proceed with a sense of utmost urgency. The Group of 77 and China would like to thank the co-chairs for their efforts in providing their reflection note and the annex which are very helpful to further the understand ing of the various views of Parties during the past sessions in order to further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text by COP 20 in Lima, as agreed in Doha and Warsaw. The Group has also, from the very beginning stressed that the work under the Contact Group on implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 and must reflect balanced progress, namely between both work streams and in both workstreams We trust that y ou as our co-chairs will facilitate our work based on the decisions 1/CP.17 . 2/CP.18 and 1/CP.19 towards elements for a draft negotiating text based on inputs and submissions by parties; and toward enhanced ambition pre 20 20 in accordance with the Durban mandate. In this regard, the Group is of the view that: The work under the Ad hoc Working Group must be under the Convention and should be based on its principles and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation; The process under the ADP must not lead to a reinterpretation or a rewriting of the Convention; The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, The outcome of the ADP must be in accordance with the objective, principles and provisions principles and provisions stipulated in the Convention, including the stipulated in the Convention, including the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilitprinciples of equity and common but differentiated responsibilitiesies and and respective capabilities;respective capabilities; The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and The negotiations under the ADP must be a party driven process, and must be fully inclusive and transparent;must be fully inclusive and transparent; The ADPThe ADP process will build on inputs from Partiesprocess will build on inputs from Parties. Any outputs of the process will reflect inputs from Parties. Any outputs of the process will reflect inputs from Parties. The work in this AdThe work in this Ad--hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, hoc Working Group should lead to a balanced, ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and ambitious, fair and equitable outcome under the Convention; and Progress depends on Progress depends on following a balanced approach that will include lowing a balanced approach that will include mitigation, adaptation and means of  implementation, in accordance with mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in accordance with the spirit of the Convention. the spirit of the Convention. The Group also looks forward to advance negotiations on the scope and nature of the intended nationally determined contributions. In doing so, the Group would like to reiterate that decision 1/CP.19 paragraph 2(d) urges developed countries, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other organizations to provide support to allow for developing countries to undertake our domestic preparations for the intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon. We welcome the full operationalization of the Green Climate Fund and urgently call for the immediate capitalization of The Convention\\'s financial mechanism, with new, additional, adequate, sustained, accessible, and predictable funding. The Group of 77 and China wants to be clear that Work stream II is an integral part of the ADP. In this regard, the Group welcomes the opening of the Technical Expert Meetings (TEMs) in March under the Work plan on Enhancing Mitigation Ambition mandated in paragraph 7 of the Durban decision. We note, however, that the TEMs only address the issues canvassed in paragraph 5(a) and (b) of Decision 1/CP.19. For this reason, the issue of the lack of Annex I ambition in the pre-2020 period, including KP commitments and the compliance with them, must also be part of the discussion. We have all agreed on the importance and the necessity for Annex I Parties to take the lead in addressing climate change. This requires that they raise their level of mitigation ambition, in particular through the obligation this year to revisit the level of ambition of QELROs under the Kyoto 3 Protocol??s Second Commitment Period, and through comparable efforts under the Convention by those Annex I Parties not participating in the Second Commitment Period. In this regard, we welcome the opportunity to address these issues at Ministerial level over coming days, and call for the ADP contact group that we launched in March to allocate time here in Bonn to further our work on paragraphs 3 and 4 of Decision 1/CP.19. Mr. Co-Chairs. The Group of 77 and China reiterates that urgency of the situation requires that we accelerate the process and initiate more dynamic and interactive sessions. The Group is prepared to engage in negotiations with a constructive spirit and a positive and optimistic attitude to s\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the LDC Group. I would like to align my statement with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, and by Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. At the outset allow me to thank you for your continued efforts and commitment to leading this process forward, as demonstrated by your reflection and scenario notes. The LDC Group has every confidence in your leadership and we are prepared to maintain our high level of engagement in this process. Co-Chairs, the LDC Group believes that a successful outcome in 2015 is possible. In this critical stage of negotiations it is important for all Parties to redouble their efforts for ambition and constructive engagement. We are encouraged by the efforts countries have taken to raise climate change in their governments\\x19 agenda. In this regard, we welcome the most recent announcement from the USA to reduce emissions from existing power plants. The LDC Group views this action as really constructive first step. This proposal, whilst very useful, does not yet lead the USA on a pathway towards achieving their goal of reducing emissions 80% by 2050 nor on a 2?C pathway leading towards the 1.5 degree target as called for by the LDCs, SIDS and Africa. We look forward to further developments in US policies as we progress toward the adoption of the 2015 agreement. Co-Chairs, the LDC Group sees no substantial problem with the way you have proposed to proceed during this session. The order of discussions starting with adaptation in the first week and technology development and transfer in the second week is acceptable to our Group, as long as adequate time is given to each element. Co-Chairs, for LDCs, the 2015 agreement should embrace all of the elements reflected in decision 1/CP17, even if there are institutions already established by COP decisions. The agreement also needs to be underpinned by the latest science, and the sense of high urgency arising from the findings of the IPCC fifth assessment report. Co-Chairs, we welcome your reflections note, and the annex on \\x1clandscape of issues\\x1d is a useful way forward. However, we will need to develop a process where we can consolidate the options into a more manageable list, narrowing down the options toward a workable agreement in 2015. We will be providing our views on what we think are the preferable options within this landscape, including: how we see an agreement that is applicable to all and legally binding as wanted by the LDCs; and how to accommodate a clear reference to the specific circumstances of the LDCs, as spelt out in Article 4.9 of the Convention. For LDCs, the key elements for the new agreement include: the need for a legally binding agreement that delivers strong mitigation ambition with short time periods no longer than five years; the inclusion of the Loss and Damage Mechanism in the new agreement; a compliance mechanism for cases where Parties do not meet their obligations; a review process to assess the adequacy of the aggregate proposals to ensure that they are consistent with emission pathways to limit global average temperature increases to below 1.5??C above pre-industrial levels over the long-term; and adequate and predictable finance, technical support and capacity building for both adaptation and mitigation. Furthermore, LDCs want to see how a legally binding agreement applicable to all, can accommodate a clear reference to the specific circumstance of the LDCs, as per article 4.9 of the Convention. Co-Chairs, our Group believes that Parties need to have a discussion about the legal form of the 2015 agreement. While we acknowledge that there are sensitivities with this discussion, we need to ensure that the text we develop is consistent with the legal form of the outcome. The legal form will no doubt be a political decision and so we need \"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs. The Dominican Republic has the honor of speaking at representation of! Central American Integration System (SICA), while we adhere to the statement submitted by Bolivia on behalf of G77 + China. According to the 2014 Global Climate Risk Index, our region is They find 4 of the 0 most vulnerable countries in! planet and recent results of the! Working Groups of! IPCC stress that the elevation of level of sea ??and extreme meteorological phenomena and with the warming by almost a degree, we are experiencing more storms frequent and intense, more droughts and the reappearance of old diseases. We emphasize that it is not only after impacts of special phenomena (\"\"shocks\"\"), the named hurricane amemolos, but also the accumulation of smaller scale events already cause us a need to adaptation (\"\"stress\"\"), due to the persistent severity of its accumulated effects. Given the urgency of the area ahead, we propose to avoid wasting precious time on procedural matters and We propose that a unique contact group be created as the most effective to tackle our task. This emphasis on impacts, in their most dire aspects, and in need to avoid them through collective action and cooperation must be our guide. This is not another point to which the objective of the Convention points us. A single contact group can be the most effective way to address our area, considering the limited composition of the delegations of many developing countries and start our negotiations for a formal and structured way where there is the required balance between WS1 and WS2, to reach balance and ambition in all the elements in the future. Regarding the pre-2020 mitigation ambition, we call urgent to all Parties and especially to developed countries to assume leadership in the fight against climate change by increasing ambition to pre-2020 commitments, establishing concrete actions in addressing the existing ambition gap pre-2020 and especially, as allocate financial support, capacity building and access to technology to promote such actions in our countries. We also reiterate our commitment to work together with All Parties, by a binding agreement in 2015, in accordance with the principles of the Convention, common responsibilities but differentiated and reach the goal of all at 1.5 ? C above 9. Expect to intensify support for the Workstrearn 2 process and encourage you to the most developed countries to present their plans to improve ambition short term. We also welcome the commitment of the ministers at this meeting and hope that the new approach will help bring the path to greater ambition and ultimately closing the gap the emissions. Senior Co-Chairs, Also we were able to deepen our discussions on the 2015 agreement under Workstream 1 last March. In light of the last Scientific discoveries on the rise of! level of! sea \\x0b\\x0band others that worsen the effects of! climate, the level of ambition is absolutely fundamental for our group. Therefore, our response should be driven by a true sense of urgency. Also, reiterate that the provision for developed countries of financing, training and access to technology are elements essentials of 2015 agreement. The 2015 agreement should contain commitments of developed country Parties and provisions to guarantee the largest scale, adequate in the long term, of financing, foreseeable, new and additional, in addition to resources for training and access to technology to support mitigation and adaptation to the effects adverse of! climate change in developing countries and encourage resilient, sustainable and low emission development in countries in process of developing. SICA hopes that the new agreement will repair the gaps in the architecture of financing the current climate and slow flows, including the lack of of financing for concrete adaptation in the most vulnerable countries and the barriers to accessing resources can be overcome in the new agreement. Senior Co-Chairs, For the countries that make up SICA, losses and damages is a reality due to the impacts of climate change, so it should be part of 2015 agreement. Loss and damage must be a separate item in the framework of the new agreement. A separate area of ??the negotiation must be formed. with its own entity and deserves specific discussion in a session by separated. The establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism to address loss and damage represents an important step and although our work it does not continue, but must also be anchored in the new agreement. There is a lot of work to do in a very short period of time, but we are optimistic that if we work with a s\"',\n",
              "       '\"Egypt has the honour of delivering this opening statement at this session of the ADP on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Success in reaching the objective of this process must be premised on all Parties working together in good faith and in the spirit of international cooperation and mutual understanding. To have a successful outcome in both Lima and Paris, it must be balanced, comprehensive, universal, credible, legitimate, and acceptable to all, so that all will implement it. The outcome must be consistent with the Convention, enhancing its full, effective and sustained implementation, and should avoid re-writing or re-interpreting any of its provisions or principles. Above all, the principles of equity and CBDR must remain the bedrock of the 2015 agreed outcome. A formal and structured mode of VOrl{ can help us make progress towards the elements for a draft negotiating text in Lima and achieve a balanced and comprehensive agreed outcome in Paris. The LMDC looks forward to starting the formal and structural negotiation focusing on the six core elements as mandated in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17 immediately beginning at this June session here in Bonn, marked with a heightened sense of urgency. Negotiations must be Party-driven, open and transparent, inclusive, and based on consensus. There should be balance in the work under the Contact Group between the tvo work.streams and in particular the elements Within them. We welcome and take note of your efforts in preparing your informal notes, including on the landscape of issues and its annex to show Parties your perceptions and understandings on the previous informal discussions. However, this informal note could not be used as the basis of the negotiation under the Contact Group. A formal mode of Vork means that Ve should use the formal textual documents based on and taken from inputs and submissions by Parties. We should be very cautious about rewriting or renegotiating the Convention under the name of \"\"new ideas\"\" reflected in the informal note. The focus of the Contact Group is to negotiate around the six core elements, i.e., mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, capacity building and transparency of action and support and relative enhanced action instead of debating philosophically around some \"\"new ideas\"\" deviating from the principles and provisions of the Convention. Co-Chairs. Many developing countries have individually been rapidly enhancing their own climate change actions at the domestic level, as appropriate to their national circumstances, using in large their part their own resources. For example, efforts on controlling coal consumption have been implemented in China. Nicaragua is rapidly implementing its renewable energy strategy. The Philippines is seeking to \"\"build back better\"\" as part of its climate change adaptation strategy in the face of more frequent and stronger typhoons such as Haiyan. India is rapidly upscaling its renewable energy use. Bolivia and Ecuador have seriously embarked on sustainable development pathways as outlined in their national constitutions. Kuwait launched the GlIGs Management Strategy in the petroleum sector. Venezuela, El Salvador, Egypt, Malaysia, Argentina) Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Pakistan, Sudan, Sri Lanka, DRC, Mali and other countries have also all put in place programmes and policies designed to ensure that climate change adaptation and mitigation co-benefits arise from their respective sustainable development plans. These are but a few examples of actions that many developing countries are tal{ing all over Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean1 the Pacific, to contribute their equitable share in addressing climate change even if they were the ones least historically responsible for having caused the problem. These actions cou1d all be enhanced if the Convention is fully and effectively implemented in a sustained manner consistent with equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. This must be our common goal because we share a common humanity and we all live on one planet-Mother Earth. Unfortunately, we have to register our deep disappointment that almost four years from the establishment of the Green Climate Fund at Cancun, it is yet to be fully operational, without any specific amount of \"\"very significant scale\\'\\' targeted for the initial resource mobilization process agreed recently in Songdo, coherent with the guidance provided by the COP in Warsaw to the GCF, as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention. Climate financing is not only a treaty commitment of developed countries under the Convention but is also the key, together with technology transfer, to unlocking building trust and higher mitigation and adaptation ambition in developing countries, as agreed by the COP in Warsaw on long-term finance. Equally disappointing, almost two years after Doha, is the fact that nearly no developed country Party has ratified the amendment to the Kyoto Protocol for its second commitment period. Almost equally disappointing is that at the same time, no developed country has put forward in the UNFCCC any concrete proposal, much less any commitment, to increase their pre-2020 mitigation ambition beyond those that they had already pledged at Cancun and that some developed country Parties even backtracl{ed on their emission reduction targets. In this regard, we reiterate that pre-2020 ambition covers mitigation, adaptation and finance and technology support to developing countries. We call for a clear roadmap for developed countries to fulfill their financial support in the period of 2014 to 2020 including the target of 70 billion USD by 2016 and addressing barriers to technology transfer including IPRs under ADP Workstream II. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of decision 1/CP.19 has preliminarily identified these key tasks which are integral and essential part of the work of the ADP, especially for Workstream II. These two paragraphs should be seriously negotiated among Parties under the Contact Group as a matter of urgency and priority. Arrangements and further concrete measures to implement these nvo paragraphs should be captured as the main results of Lima on pre2020 ambition. Co-Chairs, The daily suffering that the populations of our respective countries, as well as of other developing countries who are likewise least able to cope with extreme weather events and other adverse climate impacts, highlight the urgency of the need for all Parties to tal{e concrete steps and actions in the ADP process. Such concrete steps are needed in order to achieve an equitable outcome that will allo\\'v Parties to enhance their actions to achieve the full, effective, sustained and enhanced implementation of the Convention. To this end, the Ll1DC has submitted a draft text proposal entitled \"\"Elements for a Draft Negotiating Text of the 2015 ADP Agreed Outcome of the UNFCCC,\"\" to be circulated to all Parties as a conference room paper and as a basis for negotiation by the Parties in the ADP. Urgent action is needed. We wish to embark on Party-driven negotiations now. We owe this to all peoples of the \\'vorld, to Mother Earth, and present and future generations. The LMDC will continue to work with you, Co-Chairs, through our active, constructive, progressive, and positive engagement and involvement in these negotiations. Thank you very much, Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, We have critical work to do here, on defining the elements for a draft negotiating text, advancing preparation of Parties\\x19 intended nationally determined contributions - specifically in identifying the information that Parties will put forward with their intended nationally determined contributions - and further exploring options to capture untapped mitigation potential. The Umbrella Group looks forward to working with all Parties to get down to business and bring further focus and clarity to these tasks. We also look forward to the opportunity our Ministers and their representatives will have to engage through the High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Friday. When Parties last met here in Bonn, we agreed we would continue the work of the ADP, under both its workstreams, through a single Contact Group: maintaining our current organisation of work, and working together to progress the substantive business of the ADP under your ongoing guidance. In relation to our work at this session, we look forward to having constructive exchanges informed by our discussions to date, and the numerous submissions in which Parties and Groups have elaborated their ideas -- in particular on the elements for a draft negotiating text. The discussions here in Bonn must provide the opportunity for Parties to better understand the range of proposals on the table, so that we can work toward identifying key issues and areas of convergence, that can serve as the basis for the contract group to begin to identify mutually accepted elements for a draft negotiating text. The Umbrella Group has the utmost confidence in the co-chairs\\x19 ability to guide us in this work. Co-Chairs, The 5th assessment report from the IPCC is now complete, and this demonstrates the urgency of our work. We are committed to finalizing the 2015 agreement in Paris, and expect countries intended nationally determined contributions to be submitted well in advance of this. We have a lot of work to do before then, however, In our work here and in Lima to define elements for a draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreement, we need to start constructing a clear overarching view of what our leaders will accept as an effective and lasting global platform for post-2020 climate action. Our work should continue to be guided by the below two-degree global goal. We need to think carefully about what elements must go in a core agreement \\x13 elements that remain sound in the context of changing circumstances and capture the highest level understandings and commitments, including a commitment by all Parties to make a contribution to the global task of reducing emissions. Provisions that don??t meet these criteria, provisions that are likely to require updating over time, which elaborate implementing arrangements, or provisions which may need to be developed further between 2015 and 2020, should be included in the wider 2015 package. And we also have to forge a common understanding around when and how draft text of the 2015 agreement appears, to satisfy both expectations of the Parties and ensure procedures are applied. Co-Chairs, We should also use this session to discuss the work we??re doing at home to prepare intended nationally determined contributions. It??s important that we all understand that each of us intends to act. To that end, we will continue to work through a range of channels to assist countries that need support to prepare their contrib\"',\n",
              "       '\"Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China and Nepal on behalf of the LDCs. Co-Chairs, First, let me thank you for your diligence and leadership throughout this process. Your scenario note lays out a sensible way to continue our discussions this week and we assure you of our full cooperation in this the final stretch to Lima. As always our work must be informed by the best available science and we begin this meeting against the backdrop of startling news from the arctic. Ahead of the U.N. Climate Summit in New York last month, NASA reported that the Arctic Ocean is losing on average about 13 percent of its sea ice every decade; that is an area equivalent to about one-third the size of the United States since records have been kept. Similar reports about unsettling changes in the Antarctic also continue to come in. The arctic melting is, of course, only one of the many disturbing climate impacts that are striking every nation and region around the world with increasing frequency and intensity. But from the perspective of a group of low-lying island and coastal nations that are highly vulnerable to sea level rise these impacts command an urgent ca ll to action. Given the reality of the impacts we are already experiencing, adaptation is absolutely critical. Of course, there are impacts that we can no longer adapt to so Loss and Damage must be included as a central element of the 2015 agreement, one that is distinct and separate from adaptation. The Loss and Damage mechanism should have technical and financial functions to support vulnerable SIDS and LDCs in addressing the direct impacts of climate change with a governance body that includes representation of SIDS. We look forward to discussing this more fully. For us, adaptation it is about survival. Co-Chairs, With Lima just weeks away, it is essential that we make significant progress this week in our discussions on Workstream 1 of the ADP, including on the nature of iNDCS. More broadly we see the need for more clarity and details in the following areas: The 2015 agreement must be legally binding protocol under the Convention, applicable to all. Ambition should be in line with delivering a long term global goal of limiting temperature increases to below 1.5 and need to consider at this session ways to ensure this. Mitigation efforts captured in the 2015 agreement must be clearly quantifiable so that we are able to aggregate the efforts of all Parties. A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the 2015 agreement; The identification of the information needed to allow parties to present their intended nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates clarity, transparency, and allows us to consider in terms of the long-term goal. Finance is a fundamental building block of the 2015 agreement, and therefore it MUST contain commitments by developed country Parties and provisions to ensure scaled-up, adequate long term, predictable, new and additional finance to support mitigation and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries. This should complement other necessary means of implementation including transfer of technology and capacity building. The new agreement should also address the gaps of the current climate finance architecture and flows, including the shortage of funding for concrete adaptation in most vulnerable countries and the barriers to access resources for those capacity-constrained countries. Both public and private flows towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development have to be scaled-up urgently and different types of financing should be used and prioritized for different activities. But we know that addressing these threats we face adequately requires substantial emissions reductions in the near-term, well before 2020, and we think that Workstream 2 is our best opportunity to meet this imperative. We have seen very constructive and solutions-oriented discussions so far in areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as cities and land use.We look forward to the sessions on CCS and short lived climate pollutants this week. AOSIS has offered a number of proposals for how this technical work can be strengthened. We need to do more to engage parties and put good ideas to work. The UNFCCC and Convention provide an important platform for exchanges between policy experts and practitioners, as well as for strengthening initiatives in areas with high mitigation potential. However, providing technical information to parties is only the first step. Translating this progress into real action on the ground will require linking it to the ongoing political process and we see important opportunities where the COP can capture information from WS2 and give it higher visibility. For example, there should be high-level events at COPs, where countries are able to provide updates and discuss national and multilateral activities they are taking to enhance mitigation effort. The ADP Ministerial at Lima should be the first of these events and it will allow countries to inform the UNFCCC of action partnerships established, such as the ones announced at the very successful SIDS Conference in Samoa last month (although with the resources and partners required for scaling them up). There is also a need for political discussions on paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. It is incumbent on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change by raising the ambition of their 2020 commitments, and with regard to KP parties, ratifying the Doha Amendment to Kyoto Protocol. In addition, we must fully implement the agreed outcome of the Bali Action Plan, particularly through immediate action by developed countries to enhance the delivery of finance, technology transfer and development, and capacity building. You have done an extraordinary job bringing us so far along in this process and success is within reach. We assure you of our continued support as we work together to achieve our goals in Lima. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. Allow me at the outset to express our appreciation to the Government of Germany for hosting this meeting, and for the Convention\\'s Secretariat for the excellent arrangements. The African Group associates its statement with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group 77 and China. Co-Chairs, on Workstream I, Our work is guided by the mandate we have from decision 1/CP.17, and we have made progress since Durban. The Doha decision and the Warsaw decision requires us to have elements of the draft negotiating text ready by Lima, as well as to identify the information Parties will provide when they communicate their INDCs. These are important milestones towards the Durban mandate. However, the African Group, is concerned by your presentation of these aspects of the same mandate separately. We are further concerned by the differing status of the two documents you provided, where INDCs are presented in the form of a draft text, whilst elements of the agreement are a non-paper. We raised concern during the last session of the ADP on this matter, and we believe a discussion on how we should capture these two aspects of our mandate should precede our discussion in this session. As Parties we should explore whether we need a single or two outcomes in Lima, and secondly whether these will be captured in the form of a decision or not. Co-Chairs our initial reflection on the substantive aspects of the two documents you presented to us, we appreciate and support your effort to focus us, and guide us to a negotiation mode of work, and we encourage you to continue doing so. Despite some shortcomings in the substance reflected in the non-paper on elements of the draft negotiating text, the paper does reflect the broad parameters of concern to the African Group. We would therefore be happy to engage with other Parties and groups to deepen our understanding of various concepts towards a successful outcome in Lima. On the INDC draft decision, it is important to have a discussion amongst Parties on how we can best deliver on the Warsaw undertaking on defining information that will be provided by Parties on their INDCs. The African Group view the draft text with concern, as it presents very precise expectations on mitigation, some optional language on adaptation, and no expectations on developed country Parties on finance, technology and capacity building, except for information presented in the Annex. We emphasise that our focus at this session should be on the information of INDC\\'s continual in the annex rather than the draft decision. The African Group reiterates its position that, the 2015 Agreement will not be a mitigation agreement; it should cover all commitment elements of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. We understand some Parties suggest that the INDCs were conceived with mitigation in mind; our understanding is that the INDCs will address all the elements. The African Group experience from Warsaw is that, the word \\'contributions\\' sought to address an impasse on the discussion of commitments and actions, rather than a reference to mitigation. We look forward to engaging with other Parties further, particularly on the adaptation INDC as this is a very important element for the African Group. We would like to state that most African countries are in a better position to develop their adaptation rather than mitigation INDCs. This is informed by our experience in developing NAPAs by LDCs, as well as the process of developing NAPs in developing countries. We see the adaptation INDC as presenting our planning efforts, our current and future adaptation needs and a voluntary recognition of our past investment, with a reciprocal communication of future support by developed countries. We further see developed countries presenting their means of implementation (technology, finance and capacity building) INDCs where they outline the extent, type, and activities to be supported on the basis of agreed MRV of support guidelines. Developed countries should further provide information on their support of INDC preparation as outlined in decision 1/CP .19, as we see this aspect in the context of Article 12 of the Convention. Co-Chairs, on Workstream II, The fundamental challenge on the pre 2020 ambition workstream is to turn the discussions we have had so far into concrete and implementable measures. Therefore providing a clearer sense of direction through the following: a. On Direction by Parties (via the COP} to the operating entities of the financial mechanism of the Convention. This could, for example, include recommendations in accordance with paragraph 4 of the GCF instrument which recognizes it functions \"\"under the guidance\"\" of the COP, and paragraph 6, which provides the GCF and COP will conclude arrangements relating to guidance on policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria. They could, for instance, recommend that the GCF provide immediate financial support for REDD+ readiness, the development of pilot projects to implement renewable energy projects in developing countries, including a range of measures such as feed-in tariffs. Also, on Direction by Parties to the broader institutions and mechanisms under the Convention - to cooperate to support integrated approaches to finance, technology and capacity building for the implementation of a global renewable energy partnership among Parties - to deliver as One UNFCCC.  Finally, on Direction to developed (Annex II) Parties to scale up finance specifically for initiatives identified under workstream II including through levels of financial support to the GCF and also clear benchmarks for support towards the $100 billion target referenced in relation to 2020. Among other things, links between the scale of mitigation ambition and the scale of financial support should be further identified and specified in the decision, building on Article 11.3{d) of the Convention which calls for analysis by the COP of the level of financing available and needed to implement the Convention. Co-chairs, The African Group stands ready to engage in this session as always, in an open and constructive manner to move the ADP towards achieving its mandate for this year, which is to reach an agreement on the elements of a negotiation text for the 2015 agreement. I thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Co-Chairs. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the AILAC group of countries. At the outset, I would like to associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. I will begin by expressing AILAC\\'s appreciation for your effort and work in putting together two draft decision texts and a non-paper with a recollection of the multiple elements that have been discussed under the ADP\\'s deliberations. Chair, this is the kind of bold and effective work that we expect from you, while outcomes continue to be Party-driven, build on inputs from Parties, and reflect inputs from Parties. AILAC Members, as developing countries, are committed to engage in a constructive dialogue with all Parties and stakeholders under the ADP on this basis, continue to build bridges and genuinely reach out to others to find convergence areas, so as to achieve significant progress in this session and ensure that we agree to ambitious decisions on INDCs and WS2, and we adopt a substantive \"\"Lima draft\"\" as a result of COP20. Co-Chairs, We have only 18 days of negotiation before the closure of the Lima COP, and the sense of urgency increases for intensifying our work. We expect that this Bonn session will allow us to make significant progress. We welcome the suggestions you made in the scenario note, and will work to reach conclusions on the INDCs and WS2 decisions at this session. It is ambitious, but possible. AILAC has recently presented submissions that aim to promote further progress in our discussions. Some of the main ideas there contained deserve to be stressed here: FIRST. We have made a proposal on the overall architecture of the legally binding agreement, which provides for a durable, concise and ratifiable Paris Agreement, as well as for a system for country contributions, that captures legally binding individual commitments, while allowing for progressive scale-up of ambition over time without renegotiation or re-ratification. We have proposed specific elements for an iterative cycle of country contributions, fleshing out the steps of the cycle, and some of the modalities related to each step. We have stressed the importance of individual commitments under the new Agreement to foster ambitious domestic action to address the climate change challenge in all its dimensions. We have presented in detail the conceptual content of each of the elements to be included in the Paris Agreement, including adaptation, mitigation, means of implementation, loss and damage, transparency of action and support, compliance, legal clauses, and a section on the cycle of contributions and the rules that should govern it. We have emphasized the importance of the inter-linkages between these issues, in particular the direct relationship there is between mitigation ambition, adaptation needs and costs, and losses and damages suffered. We have made, jointly with Mexico, a concrete proposal on adaptation under the Paris Agreement. In this submission, we have explained the key components we expect, these include a global goal on adaptation, Gelleetive and individual adaptation commitments, means of implementation for adaptation, a vision on future institutional arrangements and the strengthening of metrics and assessments to enhance and catalyse effective adaptation action. We have presented ideas on how to continue to enhance the efforts undertaken under work stream 2, including concrete ideas on the TEMs, on how to capture and disseminate information resulting from the TEMs, and on ministerial engagement. Co-Chairs, We stand ready to engage with colleagues and continue our work, under your guidance, to reach ambitious consensus as soon as possible. We fully trust you to guide us through this endeavor, for which you have all our support, and can count on us for moving ahead decisively. This however cannot be achieved without the commitment of all of us to work together. This is why, through you, Co-Chairs, AILAC also would like to express that we fully trust the collaboration among all Parties, we count on all of them, and we will be reinforcing our efforts to reach out to all of them, in order to move forward together towards, towards the substantive draft decisions that we need over the coming weeks and months. Thank you.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, At the outset we wish to convey our appreciation to you for convening this additional ADP session in Bonn and for the documents you distributed since our last meeting. The non-paper, which seeks to present the various views of Parties, provide a good starting point for Parties as they commence formal negotiations in the Contact Group setting. It is our expectation that at this session Parties will make substantial progress towards delivering on the two agreed tasks of Lima from the Warsaw decision and in accordance with the mandate from Durban to finalise the elements for a draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreement, as well as identify the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their intended nationally-determined contributions (INDCs). Co-Chairs, The BASIC countries highlight the need for enhanced ambition, noting that delivery on existing commitments in the pre-2020 period by developed country Parties will contribute to the enhancement of trust and confidence that are indispensable for the successful conclusion of the 2015 agreement. In particular, we stress the need for clearer indications from developed countries on meeting their commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020 and beyond, in particular through meaningful and substantial contributions to the Green Climate Fund. We welcome the announcements made by some developed countries for the initial capitalisation of the GCF, and call on other developed countries to do likewise as soon as possible, but no later than the pledging session for the Fund\\x19s mobilisation in November 2014. We believe that the Lima COP is an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement, which requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention, in order to enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and achieve its Objective as stated in Article 2. As agreed at COP17 in Durban, the 2015 agreement should be in accordance with the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities. We would like to take this opportunity to re-emphasise that developed countries should take the lead in addressing climate change in accordance with their historical responsibilities, the latest available scientific evidence on climate change trends and the IPCC AR5. We urge developed countries to implement their commitments under the Convention towards developing countries for the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support and highlight the importance and relevance of Article 4.7 of the Convention in this regard. We reiterate that the six core elements for the 2015 outcome have been identified in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17 and that these should be addressed in a balanced and comprehensive manner through an open and transparent, inclusive, party-driven and consensus-building process. We believe that the agreement must provide an inclusive, equitable and effective framework within which Parties can put forward their contributions to keep the world on a path to limiting the increase in average global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius. In this regard, the agreement should allow Parties to progressively enhance their contributions, without providing for regression on existing commitment. It is our view that Parties\\x19 intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) must cover mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building, in line with Parties\\x19 respective commitments under the Convention. We emphasise that the information that Parties will provide when putting forwards their INDCs would also need to be accordingly differentiated between the developed and developing countries in accordance with Article 12 of the Convention. We further stress that the purpose of such information is to facilitate the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDCs in accordance with the Warsaw decision. We are convinced that adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change, experienced both now and in the future. Adaptation is an issue which requires a global response and is as important as mitigation, and all elements in paragraph 5, decision 1/CP.17 should be treated in a balanced manner in the 2015 agreement. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) could be the basis for Parties\\x19 adaptation INDCs. Investment in adaptation by 3 developing countries would represent an adaptation contribution. Also, the Lima conference must ensure adequate resource allocation to the Adaptation Fund and the adaptation window of the Green Climate Fund. The Lima conference must provide clarity on how developing countries will be supported in the implementation of their contributions under the 2015 agreement, given the serious socio-economic challenges they face and their urgent efforts to eradicate poverty. The 2015 agreement must establish a clear link between the actions by developing countries to contribute to effectively addressing the climate change challenge and the scale of finance, technology and capacity-building support required by them for implementation. It is important that the 2015 agreement give effect to the principles of equity and CBDR&RC through implementation of provisions of the Convention that reflect Parties\\x19 common and differentiated commitments, related to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building. We believe that existing institutions and mechanisms created under the Convention should be used and further strengthened beyond 2020. The elements of the 2015 agreement should strengthen and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of climate action. This will be done through provisions to strengthen institutional linkages between the adaptation committee and the Technology Executive Committee with the Standing Committee on Finance with the GCF and other operating entities of the Convention??s Financial Mechanism. Co-Chairs, Regarding the pre-2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. We call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and emphasise the importance of revisiting and significantly increasing ambition of QELROs in 2014 and in line with what is required by science, and comparabl\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, The EIG countries have come here to build on the positive signals given at the UN Climate Summit by many Parties. I am pleased to to inform you that EIG members have announced during the recent UN Climate Summit financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund: Mexico has announced 10 Millon US$, Korea has announced a contribution up to 100 Million US$ including the existing pledge and Switzerland has announced that it is considering a contribution of at least 100 Million US$. The EIG members are ready to capitalize the GCF, we hope others as well! The EIG countries are very committed to agree by Lima on elements of a draft negotiation text of the 2015 Agreement, on ex-ante information and on the modalities of the INDC process. Further we must set up a robust process to identify options to enhance global mitigation ambition. The EIG thanks you for the issued draft texts on INDCs and enhance pre-2020 climate action as well as the non-paper on elements on Parties\\' views and proposals on the elements for a draft negotiating text. We support your approach in guiding us to a successful outcome in Lima and are ready to work on the basis of the issued draft texts. We support your aim to finalize the draft decisions on INDCs and enhance pre-2020 climate action here at this session in Bonn. In parallel, we also must advance here by identifying jointly what elements are supported by all Parties to be in the enduring new instrument to come into effect from 2020. It is with this goal that we have to work on the basis of the non-paper on elements on Parties\\' views and proposals on the elements for a draft negotiating text. Let me also briefly- before we need to go to work urgently- confirm, that all the EIG Parties are sincerely engaged in domestic preparations of their INDCs and are strongly committed to a timely communication ahead of COP21 of their INDCs and the up front information ensuring clarity, transparency and understanding. The EIG takes the view that it is important to ensure a process that allows for clear, transparent and understandable mitigation commitments. A similar bottom-up approach may also be beneficial for adaptation. However, such a process on adaptation would have to reflect important differences between adaptation and mitigation, it would have to follow different timelines, and the followup to the submission of national development strategies and plans would have to be adaptation specific. The EIG therefore sees a benefit of outlining also in Lima a specific bottom-up approach with regard to adaptation. Let me also bring to your attention that the EIG countries support a multilateral process on the INDCs starting from the first quarter 2015 and accommodation all Parties and their circumstances. Such a multilateral process should be facilitative, non-intrusive, non-punitive where all Parties share information on the underlying effort of their INDCs and their considerations on equity, fairness and CBDR/RC regarding their INDC in view of the 2 degrees goal. Such a process will demonstrate that each Parties INDC is part of a collective, global effort to combat climate change. In short: the process should allow for clarification, compilation, calibration with what is needed to achieve the 2 degrees objective, and set the basis for cooperation to close a possible gap. It will build trust in the run up to Paris and set a good basis to consider enhanced action through international cooperative initiatives. Mr. Co-Chair, we are ready to work with you on the documents provided towards a successful COP in Lima. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. As this week represents the last time that we will formally meet before Lima, it is crucial that we work to make progress so as to advance key areas in preparation for a successful outcome at COP 20. We have set out our priority areas in our recent ADP submissions. Firstly it is essential that we make progress towards agreeing the decision on intended nationally determined contributions, to be adopted in Lima. We have a clear mandate on this from Warsaw. Given that we expect all Parties that are ready to do so ? including all major and emerging economies ? to come forward by the first quarter of 2015 with their INDCs, adopting a decision in Lima that ensures transparent, quantifiable, comparable and ambitious mitigation commitments is essential. The decision should also provide for an international process before COP 21 to consider and analyse the INDCs presented by Parties in order to take stock of the aggregate level of ambition in relation to the below 2?C objective as well as to allow Parties to present the ambition and fairness of their contributions. We would also like to consider the ideas of some Parties on using the pre COP 21 process to facilitate Parties coming forward with INDCs. We should aim to have agreed this decision by time we leave Bonn, working from the co-Chairs\\' draft as a basis. We have provided some comments on that text in our recent ADP submission. Secondly we must make progress towards further defining and clarifying the elements of the 2015 Agreement, with a view to adopting a draft elements text in Lima. With only a few months remaining before a full negotiating text needs to be tabled, Lima is a critical step. Our mandate is to agree a draft elements text at COP 20 and we must stick to that \\x13 we do not agree with those who suggest otherwise. The following four areas of the 2015 Agreement need to have a particular focus in this session: First, the role of INDCs in operationalising differentiation. Second, the MRV, accounting and compliance rules base ? in particular which rules need to be agreed by COP 21 to allow the finalisation of mitigation commitments by all Parties in Paris. Third, A cycle for regularly strengthening mitigation ambition by all Parties after 2020. Fourth, What to include in the 2015 Agreement and accompanying decisions in relation to adaptation and support, building on existing institutions and processes. We have set out some ideas on these areas in our submission and we would like to exchange on these with other Parties. We welcome the co-Chairs\\' elements non-paper as a useful attempt to capture the views expressed by Parties. However in our submission we have highlighted that there are a number of aspects where we consider the EU position is not well reflected. We also consider that it is essential that during this session the options on key elements of the 2015 Agreement are rationalised to move to a simpler and more concise document. We also need to move towards identifying those issues on which Ministerial guidance will be needed to agree the elements text in Lima. In that context the recent submissions from various Parties serve as useful input. Thirdly we need to continue to make progress on increasing pre-2020 mitigation ambition of all Parties in order to adopt a decision on this in Lima. It was encouraging that a large number of countries, private sector entities and other organisations came together at the UN Secretary General??s Climate Summit to launch initiatives to reduce emissions in the pre-2020 period. We should build on this momentum and find effective ways to move forward in 2015 and beyond. Discussions in June and \"',\n",
              "       '\"Climate change is one of the most serious global challenges of our time. We underscore the fact that developing countries continue to suffer the most from the adverse impacts of climate change, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and the impact of response measures, even though they are historically the least responsible for climate change. Accordingly, we call for developed countries to take the lead in responding to climate change. Climate change threatens not only the development prospects of developing countries and their achievement of sustainable development but also the very existence and survival of countries, societies and the ecosystems of our Mother Earth. Developed countries, given their historical responsibility, have to take the lead in addressing the challenge of climate change in accordance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, particularly the principle of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and provide financial and technological support to developing countries in a transparent, adequate and predictable manner. We reaffirm our determination to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties at its twenty-first session (December 2015) which will come into effect and be implemented from 2020. We further reaffirm that the agreement should encompass, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support as elements, and to organize our work with a view to making available a negotiating text before May 2015. There is an urgent need to close the pre-2020 ambition gap. We express concern about the lack of fulfillment of commitments by developed countries. In addressing this gap, the focus must not be limited to mitigation only but also address gaps relating to finance, technology and support for capacity-building. We emphasize that developed countries must take robust and ambitious mitigation commitments, with ambitious quantitative targets for limiting and reducing emissions, as required by science and mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Increasing pre-2020 ambition must be achieved inter alia the acceleration of the implementation of the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the outcome of the Bali Action Plan in accordance with principles and provisions of the Convention, with developed country Parties taking the lead. The extent to which developing countries will effectively implement their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will depend on the effective implementation by developed countries of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding 3 priorities of developing countries, including in the context of the right to development. Mr. Co-Chairs, Developing country Parties that have not yet communicated a nationally appropriate mitigation actions, are urged to do so at the earliest possible opportunity in accordance with their respective national circumstances, in the context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, finance and capacity-building, consistent with the provisions of the Convention. Developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex I of the Convention shall implement without delay their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention and, if also a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, their quantified emission limitation or reduction commitment for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We call for the ADP contact group that we launched in March to allocate time here in Bonn to further our work on paragraphs 3 and 4 of Decision 1/CP.19. Mr. Co-Chairs, The G77 and China reaffirms that developed country Parties shall strive to implement policies and measures to respond to climate change in such a way as to avoid negative social and economic consequences for developing country Parties, taking into account Article 3, Article 4.8, Article 4.9 and Article 4.10 of the Convention, and shall assist these Parties to address such consequences by providing support to highly vulnerable countries in particular LDCs and SIDS. Developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex I of the Convention shall revisit their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, with the aim of increasing such targets or commitments to at least 40% below 1990 levels by the year 2020 and adjusting, resolving or removing any conditions associated with their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. Enhanced action and international cooperation on adaptation is urgently required to enable and support the implementation? of adaptation actions aimed at reducing vulnerability and building resilience in developing countries, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing countries that are particularly vulnerable. The 2015 outcome needs to reflect a long-term vision that will ultimately help Parties in particular developing countries undertake adaptation, going beyond building resilience. We stress that adaption is an additional development burden and requires significant support from developed countries. In this context, we reiterate the need to scale up adaptation finance in accordance with provision and principles of the Convention, in particular Art 4. Mr. Co-Chairs, The Group believes that the process for the formulation and implementation of NAPs is key for communicating and supporting adaptation and this must clearly reflected. The 2015 agreement should recognize the diversity of individual and collective adaptation efforts and contain links to finance support by developed country Parties. Technology development and transfer from developed countries and Annex II Parties to developing countries is a key enabling element for ensuring 5 ? enhanced mitigation and adaptation actions by developing countries. Effective and enhanced climate change actions by developing country Parties depend on the effective provision of support, including finance, for technology development and transfer from developed country Parties. A provision should be incorporated in the agreement .to enhance action on the development and transfer of technologies and know-how, including financing of transfer and access, and the removal of barriers. There is an urgent need to have a clear commitment of Developed country Parties to provide at least USD70 billion per year by 2016 rising to USDlOO billion per year by 2020 as a floor for accounting, and leading to further increased commitments on the provision of financial support for the post2020 period. A clear roadmap, including targets, timelines and sources, is needed to ensure the scaling up the finance. The financial support should be primarily from public sources and only supplemented by private sources. We need to operationalize what we have agreed regarding issues of adequacy, accessibility, predictability, sustainability, additionally and transparency of the ?provision of finance by developed countries. As a priority, the 2015 agreement shall reflect the need to finance adaptation and deal with the gaps in this regard while maintaining balanced support of both adaptation and mitigation. To the extent possible, current mechanisms such as the standing committee on finance should be utilized and allow for ambitious, sustainable and predictable resources for the financial mechanism, including clear quantified pathways and short and long-term quantified goals. The Green Climate Fund should be strengthened and anchored in the new agreement. The issue of early and full capitalization of GCF should be considered as a priority action to fulfill the pledges of the Developed Countries. Its initial capitalization should be immediate and at a very significant level. Mr. Co-Chairs, It is important to develop a mechanism for the measurement, reporting and verification of support. provided to developing country Parties in order to ensure transparency, predictability and sustainability of the provision of support resources ensuring compliance by developed country Parties with their financial obligations. Developed country Parties, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other organizations in a position to do so, should provide support to developing country Parties for the preparation of their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), communication of information on their INDCs, and implementation of their enhanced actions after 2020. The adverse impacts of climate change are devastating societies in the developing world, threating the right to development and threatening the survival of peoples and nations. Developing countries are suffering from the permanent effects of extreme weather events that are drastically undermining progress achieved in poverty eradication and sustainable development. We need structural solutions to the climate crisis as well as immediate measures in order to address the impacts of extreme events. The COP has acknowledged that loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change includes, and in some cases exceeds, that which can be reduced by adaptation. Therefore, The G77 and China calls for the inclusion of the Warsaw international mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts, established at COP19, in the 2015 agreed outcome, as an additional element of the 2015 agreement. Because Intended Nationally Determined Contributions represent the effort each country is willing to make in the global effort to fight climate change, they must be seen in a balanced and comprehensive context pursuant to 7 decisions 1/CP .17, 2/CP .18 and. 1/CP .19 in accordance with the principles and provisions of the convention. Developed country parties shall provide finance, technology transfer and capacity-building support. Developing countries will require provision of adequate support for their domestic preparations of their intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon, as well as for the implementation of their enhanced action. The G77 attaches particular importance to the issue of the legal form of the 2015 agreement and therefore calls for a proper discussion in that regard. The elements identified in decision 1/CP.19, paragraph 2(a) namely mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity building, development and transfer of technologies and transparency of action and support must be treated on an equal footing. The provisions of the 2015 agreement should focus on enhanced actions under these six core elements recognizing the importance of addressing loss and damage in the 2015 agreement. The Group of 77 and China views Workstream II (WSII) as an integral part of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban ??platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) and as linked to the success of Workstream I (WSI). Enhanced pre2020 ambition will not only provide a strong basis for post-2020 cooperation, but is also necessary to avoid higher costs and risks associated with adaptation and mitigation in the long run. As we engage in a Contact Group setting, our work must reflect balanced progress in both workstreams, as well as between workstreams. Through WS II, all countries should demonstrate their political will recognizing that developed countries shall take the lead through enhanced\"',\n",
              "       '\"Umbrella Group Co Chairs, we welcome your handling of this session, contributing to the business like in-depth discussion we have held and to balance across the issues. We reiterate our confidence in your ongoing leadership of the ADP in Lima. We welcome the issuance of the revised texts for decisions on IDCs information and on Workstream Two, and while we too retain concerns over their content, we consider they will be a useful basis for further discussion in Lima. We also look forward to further refinement of the elements of a draft negotiating text. We need to move towards more coherence and refine the various proposals. We look for further iterations of your non-paper to be coherent, accurate and put an emphasis on areas where there is, or likely to be, convergence. We look forward to working further with you and all parties in Lima. Thank you \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, colleagues, good morning. Ecuador has the honour of delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries in Climate Change. We fully endorse the statement delivered by the Plurinational State of Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs We are now at a critical juncture in the work of the ADP. While we are still 5 weeks away from meeting again Lima at COP20 and 15 months away from COP2 I in Paris, we only have 6 working days in this session here in Bonn this week. So little time, yet sti ll so much to do. As developing countries within whose borders live 4 out of every 5 of the world\\'s poor who survive on less than $2 a day, our countries are among those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change on our economies, our societies, and our sustainable development prospects for the future, as well as also being vulnerable to the adverse social and economic consequences of response measures. Hence, achieving a balanced, comprehensive, and ambitious outcome under the Convention in both Lima and Paris that moves us towards addressing climate change effectively is of great importance to us. Like other Parties, we look forward to working with all Parties, with you Co-Chairs, and the incoming COP President Peru to ensure that Lima produces successful outcomes in line with the mandates coming from Durban and agreed tasks from Doha and Warsaw, and will build a good foundation for success in Paris on enhancing the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. We expect, in particular, that significant progress will be made at this session in: Fleshing out the elements for the draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreed outcome; Identifying the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions; and Accelerating the implementation of the Bali outcomes to enhance the pre-2020 ambition on mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology under Workstream 2. Our process in the ADP must be open, transparent,  inclusive, and Party-driven, and built on the consensus under which negotiating texts are collectively constructed by Parties based on their inputs and submissions. We should formally negotiate with each other in the Contact Group format, rather than have informal bilateral dialogues between different Parties and groups of Parties. In order to make progress in this session and achieve a successful outcome in Lima, the negotiations should be concentrated on the core tasks agreed by the Warsaw decision - elements and information -without overburdening our work by adding other issues outside the agreed tasks from Warsaw. Co-Chairs, We appreciate your work in putting together your non-paper on elements in which you have compiled Parties\\' views on the elements for the draft negotiating text of the 2015 agreed outcome in a bullet-point format. This non-paper can be a useful starting point for Parties to negotiate with each other in a formal and focused mode of work focusing on the six core elements in paragraph 5 of decision 1/CP.17. This will let us make substantial progress on the elements as rapidly as possible, keeping in mind that the views expressed by Parties as well as any conference room papers that Parties may have put forward remain on the table during such negotiations. The questions to be discussed must be on basis of the concrete and specific issues under the six core elements raised by Parties, rather than another round of \\'open questions\\' to be set in a pick-and-choose approach. Advancing the work on further elaborating the elements should be the primary focus of the work of the ADP during the October 2014 Bonn session, and hence more time in the Contact Group should be allocated to the six core elements in a balanced and equal manner, avoiding a focus merely on mitigation. The elements are the key to a successful conclusion of the 2015 agreement. Co-Chairs, The preparation of INDCs is not an independent task, another workstream or additional process beyond the existing workstreams under the ADP process. The INDCs is not an end but a means to achieve the end to adopting the 2015 agreement. The provisions of the 2015 agreement should focus on enhanced actions for the implementation of the Convention after 2020 and should not be an INDCs agreement. Therefore, the INDCs should be discussed within the context of elements. You have put forward for the consideration of Parties a draft decision on intended nationally determined contributions. We appreciate your efforts. However, we have to note that the draft decision is not a text from the Parties and it contains ideas and concepts that do not reflect any consensus arising from Party-driven negotiations. Additionally, the document goes beyond the agreed task from Warsaw, which is only to identify the information that TNDCs could contain. The theme of the draft outcome in Lima should be the INFORMATION that Parties will provide when putting forward their INDCs and not the INDCs themselves or other issues such as an ex-ante consideration process related to JNDCs, which are totally outside the agreed task from Warsaw. The Warsaw decision does not provide for expanding the discussion with respect to information to issues such as ex ante or ex post consultation, assessment or review or for narrowing the scope of INDCs only to mitigation. These should be properly discussed during the negotiations on elements. We have already put forward a draft decision text as a conference room paper on the information. We are ready to engage in negotiations on information right away, and call on all Parties to focus on putting forward their own texts on information for direct Party-driven negotiations. Co-Chairs, On Workstream 2, we note that there have been some ideas and inputs coming from the TEMs since the March session. It is necessary to conclude on the possible further arrangements of the TEMs. What is sorely lacking in this paper in its treatment of TEMs is what the Convention stresses on \"\"facilitation of access to and financing transfer of technology.\"\" Everything related to mitigation in the Convention is only related to technology development and transfer, of knowledge, processes and practices. This must be the focus of any work on mitigation and energy efficiency in the ADP. However, the workplan on enhancing pre-2020 ambition does not merely include TEMs. There are other even more important issues relating to enhancing pre-2020 ambition that need to be discussed. These include accelerating the implementation of the provision by developed countries of finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries as part of the implementation of the Bali Action Plan outcome; the ratcheting up of mitigation ambition by Annex I Parties to at least 40% below 1990 level by 2020 through the Revisit Mechanism; and ensuring that the institutions and mechanisms that have already been set up under the Convention are made fully operational and effective in providing support to developing countries. These key tasks have been set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. The operationalization of these paragraphs is an integral and essential part of the workplan on pre-2020 ambition. There should be enough time allocated in this session to further our work on these paragraphs of Warsaw decision. We want an outcome in Workstream 2 that results in real action on the ground to accelerate the implementation of these issues rather than causing further delay in actual implementation or further backsliding from commitments under the Convention. Your draft decision, Co-Chairs, falls short in this regard. Hence, we look forward to Parties putting forward their own draft texts focusing on operationalization of paragraph 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision and to engaging directly with Parties on that basis. We will continue to work with you, Co-Chairs, through our active, constructive, progressive, and positive engagement and involvement in these negotiations. Thank you, Co-Chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, Minister Pulgar-Vidal, Madam Executive Secretary and colleagues, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the LDC Group. I would like to align my statement with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, and by Nauru on behalf of AOSIS. We thank the Secretariat for the preparations made for this meeting, and also thank the government and people of Germany for their warm hospitality. We are grateful for your continued efforts to keep us up-to-date throughout the inter-session period. The documents prepared by you have been very useful, and will help us to progress here in Bonn and in Lima. This October ADP meeting plays a decisive role in our work towards the 2015 agreement. During the next six days, we have to discuss issues of utmost importance related to both the pre-2020 and post-2020 negotiation processes. Parties should build upon commonalities and work towards narrowing divergent views. Therefore, we urge all Parties to make the best use of the time available at this session. Co-chairs, We believe that Parties need to advance the elements of the draft negotiation text in a way that will help us to make a text available before May next year. The elements of the agreement were set up as initial parameters for the ADP at its inception. We need to progress in defining how each element will be reflected in the core of the legally binding 2015 agreement. In parallel, Parties should progress on the development of details regarding effective implementation of all these elements. The bullet points you made available to us present a reasonable spectrum of views and should help us to progress towards refinement. However, there are some elements that require further elaboration and we will bring forward some additional elements at this session. We believe the next step is to organize the elements in an appropriate format. We hope we will be able to do this after this session. Co-chairs, Progressing the discussion on INDCs and related information requirements, as well as on the definition of their scope, legal form and treatment once they are formulated, is of paramount importance to our group. We share your hope that Parties make substantial progress in refining the draft decision text in Bonn so that it can be adopted in Lima. It will be beneficial, if again, Parties in their discussions continue to clarify how they view the relationship between INDCs and the agreement. The LDC Group is of the view that these two are complementary. While we respect the views of Parties to present information they find relevant, we believe INDCs should primarily focus on mitigation. Adaptation and means of implementation, which are fundamental for the LDCs, should be addressed in the core of agreement and reflect the international community\\'s obligation to fulfill the needs for the most vulnerable countries so that they can cope with the adverse effects of climate change. Furthermore, the agreement should provide clear guidance to the financial mechanism to fulfill these obligations and provide resources to the operating entities. Co-chairs, It is paramount that the discussions on pre-2020 ambition build upon the outcomes of the UN Climate Summit. We should maintain this momentum by working toward a conclusion on the draft decision put forward. Let us take stock of the implementation of previous agreements, provide further guidance to the TEMs, establish a process to give consideration to how the workplan can be taken forward after 2015 and consider the role it could play after 2020. Finally Co-chairs, The LDC Group is committed to and will remain actively engaged in this process. We believe that we can have successful negotiations in Lima under your strong leadership, which in turn will build the foundations for a successful conclusion of the ADP??s work in Paris. Thank you Co-chairs.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Chairman, Belize has the honour of delivering this statement at this session of the ADP on behalf of the Central American Integration System (SICA). At the outset, SICA associates itself with the statement delivered on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Our region is strongly committed to the achievement of concrete results in the ADP before Lima and Paris in line with the mandate to further advancing the Durban Platform. We would like to thank the Co-Chairs for their efforts and at the same time recognize that there is much work to be done. As we begin this session, we are mindful of the limited time left to complete our work. We must therefore proceed with a sense of urgency, switching gears to start active negotiations. SICA underscores that adaptation needs to be strengthened in the context of the 2015 Agreement and the Adaptation Committee should be anchored in this agreement. On finance, there is an urgent need to have clear commitments, and provide clarity on scaling up the mobilization of 100 billion USD per year by 2020 to assist developing countries in both adaption and mitigation. SICA countries call on all Parties to work constructively on the elements for a draft negotiating text, on information for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and on the work-plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to help close the pre-2020 ambition gap. With respect to INDCs, we stress the need to include all the elements of the ADP mandate. Further, we consider that the required information to be submitted should be based on the provisions of the convention and relevant decisions. SICA countries underscore the centrality of the principles and provisions of the Convention, including, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and the most recent scientific evidence, in the execution of the ADP mandate. These are the foundation upon which we can elaborate an ambitious, durable and effective agreement that will promote the participation of all parties in the fulfillment of the ultimate objective of the Convention. Given that we have decided that the ADP is intended to produce a protocol, other legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force, we must initiate discussions on the issues that would arise from a legally binding agreement, that includes the legal implications of the different elements. We support the call for consideration of the establishment a contact group, at the proper time, that will consider legal aspects of such an agreement that have yet to be addressed. Mr. Chairman, Considering SICA??s role in enhancing climate change education and capacity building, we would like to underscore the importance of all elements of Article 6, which are fundamental for the effective implementation of the 2015 agreement. We are in the process of considering a submission on this matter. Mr. Chairman, We look forward over the next six days to working with you and with other Parties to ensure that we march steadily on to Lima. We reiterate our call to all Parties to build bridges to unlock outstanding issues as we strive for a successful outcome in this session and in Li\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co\\x10chairs, I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group. The Group wishes to highlight three points on the way forward. First, we believe this session has been a good opportunity for Parties to enhance their understanding of one another\\x19s perspectives. We are encouraged that Parties are starting to consider middle\\x10ground possibilities on issues of high importance; in particular, those that relate to the elements of the draft negotiation text, the intended nationally determined contributions and related upfront information. This reflects a common acknowledgment by Parties that we must make urgent and substantial progress in the negotiations. This is not least to respect the highly constrained timeline we have agreed to. Second, and related to what I have just stated, we must consider the elements of the draft negotiating text at COP\\x1020 in Lima. This is absolutely critical because, as you have rightly reminded us from the beginning of this session, the draft negotiating text mu\"',\n",
              "       '\"Umbrella Group countries are committed to delivering the ADP\\'s mandate at Paris. Time is short. We are ready to work with you and all Parties, to deliver outcomes that are ambitious, effective, durable, promote global participation and co-operation, and set us on a pathway to address climate change in tandem with building global prosperity. Co-Chairs, We know what we have been asked to deliver at Lima - elements for a negotiating text, and clarity on the information to accompany intended nationally determined contributions. We trust you, Co-Chairs, to lead us in the challenge of realizing these aims. To make them a reality we must now prioritise our negotiating time to ensure success. We see the Paris outcome as a package with three components: the legally binding agreement, schedules, and COP decisions including on INDCs. A first priority must be to give countries the guidance they need to prepare and communicate INDCs well in advance of Paris, and by the first quarter of 2015 if ready. We are ready to negotiate a decision that: Gives guidance on the upfront information that will help countries prepare clear, understandable and quantifiable emission reduction contributions; Clarifies how intended contributions will be considered after they are submitted, to aid understanding of individual countries\\' efforts and overall effort. We also think it will be essential to achieve better clarity on several key dimensions of future nationally determined contributions - including the length of initial contributions, methodological approaches, the approach to accounting rules, and ensuring the final form of contributions supports the broadest possible participation. These issues will be material to Parties\\' ability to finalise contributions, so must be a near term priority. Co-Chairs, The Warsaw decision made clear that INDCs are nationally determined. But to meet our global goal, it is essential all countries contribute to reducing or limiting emissions. Umbrella Group countries see# the up-front processes in 2015 - including upfront information and ex-ante consideration - as processes designed to be fit for the purpose of building collective confidence in contributions toward the Convention\\'s overall objective of reducing global emissions.  In tandem, we must consider approaches that are fit for purpose for other elements of the 2015 agreement, including adaptation and support. We will also need to consider how to embed a cycle of contributions over the longer term, and design a transparency framework that supports the agreement. So another priority for this session must be to generate a more focused understanding of the elements for the 2015 agreement. The outcome from Lima should set us up to establish core provisions for Paris Agreement and areas to be further elaborated in COP decisions. This needs to recognize the parameters of the common rule-set we\\'ll all be working towards. Transparency and accountability provisions using a common framework will be critical for an effective and credible agreement. If we are to reach agreement on elements for a draft negotiating text, we will need a more concise, streamlined and structured elements document that: Draws out the areas which can genuinely form a basis for agreement in Paris; Starts to delineate what the Paris agreement itself should contain, and what complementary, as well as subsequent decisions can elaborate. We trust you to guide us - as you have done - through the next step of generating a more concise and focused elements document for Lima, refiecting on our discussions at this and previous sessions, and submissions made by the full range of Parties and Groups. Co-Chairs, A further priority is to continue the useful progress the ADP continues to make on enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition through workstream 2. The technical expert meetings have demonstrated how countries can build enabling environments and overcome barriers to effective mitigation action. Importantly, they are also bringing into our discussions international and regional organizations, sub-national entities and the private sector. We look forward to this session\\'s meetings on carbon capture, storage and use, and short-lived greenhouse gas emissions. We need to continue to take stock of the expert meetings we have held throughout the year, including hearing examples of how our discussions may be bearing fruit back at home and the domestic context. In considering how we take this work forward into next year, we need to ensure we maintain the practical, educational and co-operative focus that has made the technical expert meetings a success. We also need to keep in mind how further requirements under this workstream may impact Parties\\' and the UNFCCC\\'s resources in tandem with intensive negotiations and preparations for Paris. Co-Chairs, The Umbrella Group sees a critical condition to our success: that is ensuring that the ADP builds a genuinely global, common legal platform for climate action by all. That is the core of our mandate. That platform should recognise national differences, and promote efforts that are appropriate to each country\\'s circumstances and capacities. But it cannot afford to perpetuate a divided world view. Co-Chairs, We continue to offer you our ongoing support in your leadership of this process. We look forward to working with all Parties to deliver a successful ADP outcome in Lima.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Ecuador is delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. Co-Chairs, we are strongly dissatisfied about the process of this Contact Group so far. Instead of undertaking direct negotiations among the Parties on drafting text, we have lost valuable negotiating time this week with more open-ended discussions. This leaves us very concerned about how you plan to organize our work in Lima. We must be clear. At Lima, we expect the process to change from the very first day. We expect to see the Contact Group start direct negotiations among the Parties. We want to see draft texts from Parties on screen, on paper, being directly negotiated by the Parties with each other, in order to narrow differences, find convergence, and achieve consensus. We support what the BASIC countries and the African Group have called for, that the Contact Group set up focused open-ended groups of Parties to work on drafting and concluding texts. These focused groups must have clear mandates, co-facilitated in a balanced way by developed and developing country colleagues selected by the Parties themselves, and focused on addressing issues identified and raised by Parties and which need to be settled among themselves. Draft texts can come only from Parties and have legal standing as a negotiating basis when they are submitted as CRPs. The COP\\x19s rules of procedure as applied to the ADP do not allow the co-Chairs to exercise the rights of Parties and table texts, as you are both well aware. We know that you will adhere to the Party-driven process. We want to help you with that. This is why we expect a shift in the mode of our work in the Contact Group to a formal and direct negotiating mode among the Parties through elements-focused drafting groups from Day 1 in Lima. We do not want to lose more time. We said before that convergence and consensus cannot simply be declared into being, these have to be negotiated. As a Party-driven process, it is up to Parties to discover and decide through direct negotiations where areas of convergence exist and consensus can be achieved. As Co-Chairs, we look to you to facilitate the negotiations by accurately reflecting all Parties\\x19 views rather than exercising your own judgment on where convergence and consensus may lie. Co-Chairs, we can live with something that we have collectively worked on and negotiated together with other Parties, but not with something that has simply been handed down to us without the benefit of actual intergovernmental negotiations. Such negotiations must take place, to ensure that Lima and Paris will achieve balanced, comprehensive and consensus-based outcomes. Under the Convention, Parties have to actively make a decision by consensus, rather than assume that a decision is adopted unless Parties have a consensus to reject it. The urgency of climate change and the long-term impacts of the decisions that we are to take in this process on our economies and societies demand that we negotiate in good faith, with full knowledge, transp\"',\n",
              "       '\"South Africa makes this statement on behalf of the BASIC countries. We would like to associate ourselves with the statement delivered by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chairs, we thank Parties for sharing their views on what they would like to see in the 2015 agreement. We heard new ideas and further elaboration of ideas that where captured particularly in your Non-Paper, the draft INDC decision and the Workstream II draft text. With regard to the draft decision on INDCs, the BASIC countries have made clear their position in this session that we do not believe a stand-alone decision on the INDCs will help us in reaching a successful outcome in Paris. Furthermore, we would like to express our disappointment on how the discussions of this session were reflected on the latest version of the text, in an unbalanced and selective manner. The latest version does not \\x1cbuild the bridges\\x1d we all expected this session would. Co-Chairs, we would also like to register our disappointment on how we proceeded on the ELEMENTS discussions. We do not feel that significant progress was made at this session. Our expectation was that we would have a first reading of the Non-Paper in this session. The mode of work at this session was not conducive to capturing emerging consensus or common ground. Co-Chairs, the BASIC countries would like to support the suggestions made by the Group of 77 & China on how to organise our work for Lima. Since Lima is expected to finalise the draft elements for a draft negotiating text, it is clear is that we cannot continue in the current mode of engagement. Co-Chairs, we therefore call for an agreement here in Bonn that we start the ADP session in Lima in FOCUSED GROUPS. For this to happen we would like to propose to you, Co-Chairs, that you appoint facilitators for such groups. Co-Chairs, the mandate for the focused groups should be to produce elements for a draft negotiating text. The basis of those discussions should be your Non-Paper. We therefore would like to give you mandate to update the current non-paper and structure it to suit the suggested focused group discussions WITHOUT deleting anything from the current Non-Paper. The BASIC countries will not accept the deletion of any content of the current Non-Paper as we did not yet have a first reading of the Non-Paper. Co-Chairs, just to emphasise the points that we are making in this statement, we propose the following: that we agree to start the Lima ADP negotiations with the FOCUSED groups; and ? that the focused groups should use the updated Non-Paper as the basis of the discussion. If we can reach an agreement here in Bonn on the mode of work in Lima, it will make our task in Lima much easier. We should start the Lima discussion in a focused manner\"',\n",
              "       '\"I have the honor to speak on behalf of the AILAC group of countries. We associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. This week\\'s discussions highlight the urgent need to work constructively and decisively in a more focused manner to secure the Lima outcomes. Co-Chairs the modality of work of this session has been helpful in furthering the understanding of each other\\'s position, we now need to engage in a modality of work that allows for more focused negotiations .. We have significant conceptual progress during this session. These include issues such as the need for global goals on mitigation, means of implementation and adaptation. AR5 has indicated the need for a carbon-neutral global economy by mid-century. We want a planet that is resilient to the impacts of climate change and where all investments are directed towards low carbon and climate-resilient development. This will provide the required longer-term guidance that will support a global transformation. We have heard interesting ideas this week on the issues of differentiation, cycles, sequencing, and the need to design the appropriate vehicles for action in the new climate regime. AILAC is eager to hear furth~r detail on these ideas from our negotiating Partners. We share a collective commitment to make adaptation a central part of the agreement. A balanced outcome that reflects all the elements of the ADP is fundamental to account for the interlinkages between all of them, and that mitigation ambition and adaptation action require of the provision of means of implementation to secure the desired enhanced levels of ambition. Work under WS2 must urgently address the significant pre-2020 mitigation gap resulting from the existing mitigation commitments, targets and pledges and the aggregate level of ambition needed to reach below 2 degree or 1.5 Celsius goal, in order to secure enhanced mitigation ambition in the short term by all Parties. Co Chairs, We commend your efforts to guide our discussions and identify areas of convergence. In this spirit, let us point out some important concerns regarding the most recent version of the INDC draft decision. We feel that this new iteration doesn\\'t reflect progress made by all parties during this session. Despite parties\\' efforts to elaborate on the details on how Adaptation and Means of implementation need to be reflected both in the body and Annex of the decision, we find that this new version blurs the contents of these two elements within the decision, rather than building on the many clarifications and details provided by Parties. Co-Chairs, We are set to define here a long-term system. We need to keep this focus. We can\\'t afford to miss the opportunity we have now in our hands to make the future regime operative. The INDCs are one of the vehicles to achieve this, none of the Parties have rejected that idea. The purpose of INDCs, beyond clarity, transparency and understanding of the contributions, is to reflect contributions of each country to meet the ultimate objective of the convention as well as any other goals to be set forth in the new agreement. The decision we take in Lima needs to provide a space to improve ambition if the aggregate effort falls short. This needs to be made possible for the short, medium and long term. The new version of the text creates a greater unbalance, and plays down the robustness on science and equity within the assessment process of communicated contributions in the context of global goals that are to be reflected within the 2015 Agreement. While we recognize that contributions are nationally determined, AILAC strongly favors the definition of specific elements that define the necessary guidance that the Convention must provide to the work of the Parties towards achieving its ultimate objective. Top-down elements are necessary for this regime to deliver on its objectives. This text moves further away from this objective. Co-Chairs, let us be clear: we welcome your bold guidance and your effort. We ascertain the crucial role that we expect you to play in driving us forward to reach consensus. We recognize the value of your initiative and urge you to capture the broader spectrum of requests for greater. Hence we encourage you to produce a new version for Lima that captures this week\\'s spirit, ideas and proposals, while conducting further consultations with Parties. AILAC is an ambitious yet pragmatic group, solution-oriented and flexible. We are ready to listen to new ideas, revisit ours with an aim to reach and ambitious outcome in. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"We need to keep in mind three core tasks for this session and Lima agreed by the Warsaw Decision: \\'elaborating the elements\\', \\'identifying the information\\' and \\'accelerating the pre-2020 ambition\\' and negotiate in a formal and focused mode under the Contact Group around these three tasks and be in full accordance with the mandate from Durban. The text on Lima outcomes on the ADP should be collectively constructed by Parties, based on the inputs from Parties and reflect various views and options in a balanced, objective, inclusive, comprehensive and Party-driven manner. We are concerned about the fact that the Draft Text on ADP 2-6 Agenda Item 3 Implementation of Decision 1/CP .17, \"\"Information on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions\"\" lacks of central elements that are part of the principles and provisions of the Convention, which are among others the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities. These elements have been removed from the second version of Draft Text. This sends a signal that the documents produced by the Co-Chairs are not balanced and fall short from reflecting the positions of all Parties. The Co-Chairs should facilitate the negotiation identifying the areas of convergence and divergence in a balanced manner and promote negotiation among Parties. We consider it is urgent that we have the opportunity to interact among Parties on specific issues with focused negotiations, and trust that we will move towards such an organization of work in Lima. Central issues repeatedly stated by the Group like the appropriate balance in the core elements, are not reflected in the last document presented by the Co-Chairs. The Draft Text on ADP 2-6 Agenda Item 3 Implementation of all the elements of Decision 1/CP .17, \"\"Information on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions\"\" does not reflect other constructive proposals by Parties. Mr. Co-Chairs, We have concerns on the lack of progress on drafting the text on the elements of the Agreement. If we leave this session without clarity then we will repeat this very same process in Lima and this can put at risk the process for the Agreement. We do not want to be in a situation of \"\"take it or leave it\"\" or to have huddles in the last minute, due to the lack of interaction in the previous sessions. We have to modify the dynamic and the format of the sessions turning it into a negotiating Parties interaction. We are beginning to have huge political pressure from civil society, in order to have an outcome that brings solutions to climate change challenges. We need to start with a process with a text that reflects all proposals and allow us to negotiate. We need to have a clear arrangement on the organization of work in Lima, in order to avoid lack of progress and ensure the accomplishment of the agreed tasks from Warsaw. ??We propose to establish focused groups to enter into formal, focused and Party-driven negotiation in order to prepare draft text around all the core elements of the Agreement based on inputs from Parties in a collective, constructive and Party-driven manner. In accordance with paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17. We need a draft negotiation text on all the elements of ADP. INDCs must promote enhanced actions in accordance with principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capacities. Mr. Co-Chairs, We recognize the progress being made so far under WS2 to enhance mitigation ambition, including the TEMs sessions and high-level discussions on\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. Allow me at the outset to express our appreciation to the Government and People of Peru for hosting this meeting, and the Convention Secretariat for the excellent arrangments. \"\"The African Group associates itself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group 77 and China. Co-Chairs, on Workstream I, The African Group reiterates the call we made at the 6th part of the 2nd session of the ADP. \"\"The AGN would like to see a single decision on post 2020 arrangements under the Durban mandate, covering both the INDC process and elements of the negotiating text. We proposed that you avail such a decision for Parties to consider during this opening plenary. Further, we called for assurance on a mode of work in the parallel sessions where Parties can engage directly with the text and each other; hence not rely on iterations by you, which have proved to miss some important points raised by some delegations. In light of limited time available in this session, and in trying to support you in working towards an ambitious outcome in Lima, we would welcome the appointment of facilitators who would assist you helping Parties engage on text. Co-chairs, having addressed how we undertake our work, the African Group would like to provide son1e key reflections on the substance of the documents you have prepared concerning workstream I, we would like to raise the following concerns, The mandate of the ADP with specific reference to the elements of the negotiating text has been reduced to making a recommendation, whilst the INDC process has been elevated to a mandate, and this is inconsistent with the Durban mandate, We are further of the view that the draft decision provides for concrete mitigation expectations whilst other elements are particularly adaptation and provision means of implementation are optional. The draft decision further prejudges what will be an integral part of the agreement and what will be complementary, which makes the text imbalanced The weakening of developed countries support obligations in the new agreement, whilst opening space for developing countries to provide support under the pretext of \\'parties in a position do so\\' is unacceptable as it changes the fundamental obligations under the Convention On the ex-ante assessment process, the references to science only pertain to implications of mitigation ambition on the temperature goal, however it should further explore the implications of the temperature goal to developing country adaptation burden. We are of the view that any assessment should include the assessment of means of implementation, particularly of adaptation support. Co-chairs, on the elements text we see some of our proposals reflected, some not accurately reflected, and we look forward to engaging with other Parties in textual negotiation, particularly in addressing aspects that seek to reinterpret the Convention. Co-Chairs, on Workstream II As the Group indicated to the COP President in our opening statement yesterday, we have to build on the technical expert meetings successes (TEM) and move towards a more structured technical expert process (TEP) that helps Parties deepen their analysis, catalyses new forms of cooperation, supports an upward cycle of cooperation and accelerate implementation of commitments under the Convention. In operationalizing such a vision, the Africa Group calls for the following sequence: The technical expert process or TEP is an organized set of technical expert meetings with a focus on the implementation of policies, practices and technologies that are substantial, scalable and replicable. The process would enable more systematic analysis of opportunities for cooperation on concrete actions to realize mitigation opportunities in different thematic areas in accordance with nationally defined development priorities. To help move from information to action, the outcomes of the various themes would be synthesized into a summary of actions and cooperation that together would help put the world on a path towards curbing emissions and realizing co-benefits in the pre-2020 period to achieve the objective of the Convention. It would summarize in politically relevant terms the opportunities for cooperation inside and outside the Convention, potential for syergies among different thematic areas, actions and co-benefits, and opportunities for high-level engagement and action. The objective of the process is to support ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION in practice, through action within and outside the Convention. It would support the development of concrete initiatives, such as the African proposed Global Renewable Energy Partnership to strengthen cooperation between developed and developing countries and speed the transition to renewable energy, while addressing energy poverty, empowering communities, increasing employment and supporting development On the Workplan and its timeline. The current Workstream II would culminate in a synthesis and launch of new initiatives in Paris. The first round of the TEP would run 2016-2017 and conclude with a synthesis outcome, high-level engagement on options for cooperation, and a review. In parallel with the review, a second round would run 2018-2019. The two-year iterative process would enable an upward cycle of ambition and cooperation. It would be aligned with other reviews - including those on finance - to help coordinate action on mitigation and other related areas. Co-chairs, as you suggested, the Africa Group already started talking and consulting with Groups and Parties on this proposal and other ways and n1eans to strengthen the work under Workstreams II as to put the world on track during the pre-2020 period to achieve the objective of the Convention. Co-chairs, in conclusion we welcome the recent pledges towards the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund and the very positive signal it sends as a reflection of the willingness of developed countries to honour their financial contributions under the Convention. We wish to reiterate that we are developing a long-term multilateral system that will affect Africa\\'s development far into the future. In this regard we wish to stress that our positions on adaptation and means of implementation are a reflection of the realities that Africa will face going forward under the new regime, and cannot be compromised on account of the positive assurances provided from developed countries in the short-term. The African Group stands ready to engage in this session as always, in an open and constructive manner to move the ADP towards achieving its important mandate for this session, which is to reach an agreement on the elements of a negotiation text for the 2015 agreement. I thank you \"',\n",
              "       '\"Thanks Co-Chairs, I have the honor to speak on behalf of the group of countries AILAC, First, I would like to associate myself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of G77 and China. I begin by expressing AILAC\\'s appreciation for their effort and work in preparing the new documents: a draft decision for the ADP and a revised version of non-paper an effort to reflect the multiple elements that are have discussed during the previous Sessions. We have carefully studied both documents and we hope that on that basis we can move forward decisively in defining the contributions determined at the national level and in the elements of the 2015 Agreement. The members of AILAC, as developing countries, are committed to participate in a constructive dialogue with all the Parties under the ADP on the basis of these advances, and to continue building bridges to find more and more areas of convergence. We hope to make significant progress in this session and to ensure ambitious decisions. Co-Chairs, Lima is the decisive moment for the future of the multilateral regime, on climate change, based on rules that are currently being negotiated. At COP 20 we will lay the foundations for the architecture of an improved regime that will guide our collective and individual actions on climate change, which will lead us to a universal and legally binding agreement that will facilitate a low global economy. in carbon and possibly carbon neutral in the middle of this century, An ambitious result in Paris requires reaching substantive products here in Lima under the ADP, COP 20 should produce: \"\"Lima Draft\"\" that defines the elements for the new agreement, and is recognized as the basis for the advance ADP make a Paris Protocol during 2015. decision on the ADP that included the following The definition of ex-ante information for the preparation and communication of the nationally determined contributions in mitigation by all Parties, to guarantee transparency, clarity, understanding, comparability, aggregation and quantification. The definition of an initial ex-ante evaluation for the consideration of nationally determined contributions in mitigation in 2015. Provisions on contributions regarding adaptation and means of implementation that reflect the individual dimension of the action to face climate change. Accelerated action to increase the ambition for mitigation in the pre-2020 period and the efficiency of its work modalities, which will allow establishing the basis for appropriate post-2020 action, increasing political support. The new agreement is an opportunity to design an iterative system in which a virtuous circle of individual contributions generates positive incentives to increase ambition over time, with a view to achieving global goals. AlLAC emphasizes the need for the Paris Agreement to be durable, concrete, rule-based and ratifiable, with a system of national contributions from all the States Parties that is dynamic and increases the ambition over time1 towards sustainable development. AILAC supports the call made by many of the Parties to advance in a more focused modality of negotiation avoiding the parallel proliferation of sessions while maintaining a comprehensive approach to all aspects under consideration by the ADP. Co-Chairs, AILAC is willing to collaborate with all colleagues and to continue our work, under their guidance, to reach ambitious consensus as soon as possible. We fully trust you to guide us through this endeavor, you have our full support to move forward decisively. We hope that this is the spirit in which our partners in this negotiation have come to Lima, to lay the foundations that will allow us to achieve progressive and concrete milestones over the next year so that at COP 21 in Paris, the Protocol to be adopted by us strengthen the climate change regime to make it long-lasting and ambitious, so climate change. Thank you so much. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, Nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, coalition of 44 island and low lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We align ourselves with the statements made by Bolivia on behalf of the G77 and China. At the outset, let me thank you for your hard work and assure you of our full trust and confidence in your leadership here in Lima. We begin this meeting on the heels of important announcements about emissions reductions from the world\\'s largest emitters, as well as long-awaited pledges to the Green Climate Fund. The news provides important momentum at a critical juncture in these negotiations. But, as the nations on the front lines of the climate crisis, and ones who are already suffering severe impacts, we start these negotiations with the somber knowledge that the progress is not nearly enough and that the decisions we make here and on the road to Paris will determine whether or not the international community takes the bold action required to ensure the survival of all our members. Still, there is no time to despair. Study after study has shown that it not too late to avert the worst impacts of climate change, but we must take action immediately and that begins with all of us here today. In order to keep global temperatures from exceeding 2 degrees C (to say nothing of the 1.5 degree threshold called for by our group) emissions must come down as soon as possible and well before 2020. We think that the discussion on near-term mitigation, under Workstream 2 of the ADP, is our best opportunity to meet this imperative and it is an absolute priority for our group. Already, we have seen very constructive and solutions-oriented discussions in key areas. The UNFCCC and Convention provide an important platform for exchanges between policy experts and practitioners, as well as for strengthening initiatives in areas with high mitigation potential, but providing technical information to parties is only the first step. Translating this progress into real action on the ground will requiring linking It to the ongoing political process and we see important opportunities where the COP can capture information from WS2 and give it higher visibility. For example, there should be high-level events at COPs, where countries are able to provide updates and discuss national and multilateral activities they are taking to enhance mitigation effort. The ADP Ministerial here Lima should be the first of these events and it will allow countries to inform the UNFCCC of action partnerships established, such as the ones announced at the very successful SIDS Conference in Samoa in September There is also a need for political discussions on paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. It is incumbent on developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change by raising the ambition of their 2020 commitments, and ratifying the Doha Amendment to Kyoto Protocol. In addition, we must fully implement the agreed outcome of the Bali Action Plan, particularly through immediate action by developed countries to enhance the delivery of finance, technology transfer and development, and capacity building. Co-Chairs, Tackling climate change is an urgent but long-term effort and the international community must work diligently to ensure that we reach a meaningful agreement next year in Paris, under Workstream 1 of the ADP. We are already at the brink of one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels with accompanying impacts far more severe than what scientists predicted just a few years ago. Therefore, the discussions on adaptation are absolutely critical in moving forward. For us, adaptation is about survival. lamentably, we are also already experiencing impacts that can no longer be mitigated and to which we can no longer adapt to. Thus, loss and Damage must be included as a central element of the 2015 agreement-one that is distinct and separate from adaptation. The loss and Damage mechanism should have technical and financial functions to support vulnerable SIDS and LDCs in addressing the direct impacts of climate change with a governance body that includes representation of SIDS. We look forward to discussing this more fully. It is essential that we also make significant progress on the nature of iNDCS. More broadly we see the need for more clarity and details is commensurate with the scale of the challenge that we are facing with the increasing impacts of climate change. in the following areas: 1. The 2015 agreement must be legally binding protocol under the Convention, applicable to all. Ambition should be in line with delivering a long-term global goal of limiting temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees and consideration of all aspects of Art. 2 of the Convention must be considered at this session. Mitigation efforts captured in the 2015 agreement must be clearly quantifiable so that we are able to aggregate the efforts of all Parties. A further elaboration of the elements to be included in the 2015 agreement; The identification of the information parties will provide when putting forward their intended nationally determined contributions in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the intended contributions towards achieving the long-term global goal and consideration all aspects of Article 2 of the Convention. Finance is a fundamental building block of the 2015 agreement, and therefore it MUST contain commitments by developed country Parties and provisions to ensure scaled-up, adequate long term, predictable, new and additional finance to support mitigation and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries. This should complement other necessary means of implementation including transfer of technology and capacity building. The new agreement should also address the gaps of the current climate finance architecture and flows, including the shortage of funding for concrete adaptation in most vulnerable countries and the barriers to access resources for those capacity-constrained countries. Both public and private flows towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development have to be scaled-up urgently and different types of financing should be used and prioritized for different activities. l assure you of our continued support as we work together, united by a sense of urgency and common purpose to do what is required. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honour to speak on behalf of Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs We believe that the Lima COP is an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement, which requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention and in accordance with its principles and provisions, in order to enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and achieve its Objective as stated in Article 2. At the outset we wish to convey our appreciation to you for the documents you distributed since our last meeting. We believe that the ADP outcome in Lima should focus on the three agreed tasks from Warsaw, i.e., elaboration of the elements for a drafting negotiating text, identification of the information on INDCs and acceleration of the pre-2020 implementation. But we are concerned that there is no clarity on the relationship between the INDCs and the future agreement. We wish to reiterate again our expectation to make balanced progress on the mandate of the Durban Platform here in Lima. We believe that in order to move this process forward there need to be upfront assurances from Parties on fundamental understandings, such as on differentiation, mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. We emphasise that the elements of the 2015 agreement should give effect to the principles of equity and CBDR&RC through implementation of provisions of the Convention that reflect Parties\\' common and differentiated commitments, related to mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building. Co-Chairs The BASIC countries highlight the need for enhanced ambition, noting that delivery on existing commitments in the pre-2020 period by developed country 1 Parties will contribute to the enhancement of trust and confidence that are indispensable for the successful conclusion of the 2015 agreement. We welcome the announcements made by some developed countries for the initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and call on other developed countries to do likewise as soon as possible. We also look forward to a clearer indication from developed countries of how the pledges that have been made will be realised and how the commitment of providing US$100bn will be implemented. It is our view that Parties\\' intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) must cover mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building, in line with Parties\\' respective commitments under the Convention. We are convinced that adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change, experienced both now and in the future. Adaptation is an issue which requires a global response and is as important as mitigation, and all elements in paragraph 5, decision 1/CP.17 should be treated in a balanced manner in the 2015 agreement. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) could be the basis for Parties\\' adaptation INDCs. Investment in adaptation by developing countries would represent an adaptation contribution. The 2015 agreement must establish a clear link between the actions by developing countries to contribute to effectively addressing the climate change challenge and the scale of finance, technology and capacity-building support required by them for implementation. Co-Chairs, Regarding the pre-2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition. We call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and emphasise the importance of revisiting and significantly increasing ambition of QELROs in 2014 and in line with what is required by science, and comparable pledges in the same timeframe by those Annex I Parties not participating in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We note with concern that the pre-2020 ambition gaps exist not only in mitigation but also in adaptation and finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. We stress that the contribution of developing countries to mitigation efforts could be further enhanced if developed countries effectively implement and significantly increase their commitments to provide finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building support to developing countries. Finally, co-chairs, the BASIC countries look forward to a constructive session and we assure you of our support and our cooperation to ensure a productive meeting here in Lima. I thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-chair, Panama has the honor to speak on behalf of the 52 countries of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, of which the following have endorsed this statement: Bangladesh, Belize, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d\\'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Honduras, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Congo, Solomon Islands, Togo, and Uganda. Mr. Co-Chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We believe the 2015 agreement should be based on the elaboration of all 6 core elements identified in decision 1/CP.17: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building. On mitigation, the new agreement must take into account the latest scientific information with the global commitment to be set at a level that would maintain the global temperature well below an increase of 1,5C. While the agreement should be applicable to all, the principles of the Convention must be respected and leadership from developed countries must guide us in the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. The nature of nationally determined contributions to be presented by all Parties should be differentiated. The 2015 agreement must be adequately informed by the work of other subsidiary bodies under the Convention and build upon important results achieved through past COP decisions. REDD+ is therefore a central element of the 2015 agreement as defined by the Warsaw REDD+ Framework. Adequate importance must also be given to Coastal Marine Ecosystems and their potential role in adaptation and mitigation. Mr. Co-chair, full support from a broad variety of financing sources, primarily from developed country Parties must be identified and allocated to REDD+ and CMEs activities. A new marl<et based mechanism, including REDD+, must be also included in the 2015 agreement. The mitigation potential of REDD+ must be fully taken into account and captured in the pre2020 ambition track. REDD+ actions should be quantified and duly recognized as a way to reduce the emissions ambition gap before 2020. Our Coalition sees four main objectives to be achieved here in Lima at the end of these two weeks: The inclusion of REDD+ and coastal marine ecosystems into the draft negotiating text, based on the supporting decisions of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework Clarification of information to be submitted along with the INDCs early next year; A successful launch of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework, as per decision 10/CP.19, and anchoring it in the new agreement; The opening of a REDD+ window in the GCF. Mr. Co-chair, in addition, as the COP President has emphasized, we need to accelerate the progress made in REDD+ by bridging the Warsaw REDD Plus Framework and the Green Climate Fund Logic Framework here in Lima. Finally Mr Co-Chair, We are looking forward to engaging with all Parties in these two weeks on the elaboration of the elements identified above. We are confident that you will assist us in the completion of this challenging task. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Co-Chairs, This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland.  The EIG countries have come to Lima to take substantial decisions on the climate agreement from 2020. Here in Lima, we must capture the key elements of the 2015 agreement in all relevant areas to address climate challenge: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The EIG is encouraged by the early announcements of the quantifiable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by China, the European Union, and the United States. I am also pleased to confirm, that all the EIG Parties are sincerely engaged in domestic preparations of their corresponding INDCs and are strongly committed to their timely communication ahead of COP21 as well as the accompanying up front information. The EIG is further encouraged by the very ambitious contributions to the Green Climate Fund of many Parties in the position to do so, including the EIG countries. We consider this as a very positive signal to underline that with political will the international community can come together and decide on elements that support a low emissions and resilient development pathway to our societies. The EIG has come to Lima to build on these clear indications for global action and cooperation and to send a clear signal to private sector and stakeholders that an effective, fair and legally binding agreement will be adopted in Paris next year. A key element for the 2015 agreement is differentiation. Differentiation is a tool to reflect different realities and circumstances with regard to equity, responsibility and capacity; to ensure fairness; and to stimulate ambition. The EIG takes the view, that for fair differentiation, self-determination is essential and needs to be complemented by guiding elements. Such guiding elements of differentiation and flexibility can be reflected in the 2015 agreement, COP decisions, or complementary assurances. The EIG is looking forward to engage with others on these is-sues. The EIG has further come to Lima to define the up front information to be submit-ted by all Parties together with their INDCs and on the modalities of the INDC process starting next year. The EIG countries support a multilateral process on the INDCs starting from the first quarter 2015 and accommodation all Parties and their circumstances. Such a multilateral process should be facilitative, non intrusive, non punitive where all Parties share information on the underlying effort of their INDCs and their considerations on equity, fairness and CBDR/RC regarding their INDC in view of the 2 degrees goal. Such a process will demonstrate that each Party\\'s INDC is part of a collective, global effort to combat climate change. In short: the process should allow for clarification, compilation, calibration with what is needed to achieve the 2 degrees objective, and set the basis for cooperation to close a possible gap. It will build trust in the run up to Paris and set a good basis to consider enhanced action through international cooperative initiatives. The EIG takes the view that it is important to ensure that the up front information and multilateral process assure clear, transparent and understandable mitigation commitments. Likewise, the EIG provides high relevance to action on adaptation to ensure a trasition towards a climate resilient planet. Thus, we consider that a bottom up approach may also be beneficial around adaptation commitments - however, fol-lowing different time lines, and the follow-up to the submission of national devel-opment strategies and plans would have to be adaptation type specific. The EIG therefore sees a benefit in outlining also, here in Lima, a specific bottom-up approach with regard to adaptation. As a third element, the ADP must advance international collaboration up to 2020 on the global ambition gap. Here in Lima, we must define continued robust work to identify options to enhance global mitigation ambition. We must grasp the positive signals of the UN Climate Summit and strengthen collaboration on opportunities and international initiatives. Mr Co-Chair, let me finally, thank you for the issued draft decision text as well as the non-paper on elements of the 2015 agreement. The EIG supports your approach in organizing our work and is ready to work on the basis of the issued draft texts. Thank you, Mr. Co-Chair. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. It is essential that COP 20 delivers on three things under the ADP, building on the progress made at our last session in October, namely: (i) a decision that addresses INDCs, including in particular up front information and the pre COP 21 international process to consider and analyse them; (ii) a decision that further enhances global mitigation ambition before 2020; and (iii) agreement on draft elements of a negotiating text of the 2015 Agreement. In relation to the draft ADP decision we welcome the initiative of co-Chairs to prepare the revised version prepared by the co-Chairs on the basis of inputs of Parties. We look forward to textual negotiations and improvements to that text here in Lima. In relation to the draft elements of a negotiating text we also welcome to the initiative of co-Chairs 10 prepare the revised non-paper. We underline the importance we attach to elements such as such as the rules base, including MRV, accounting, the cycle of ambition and compliance in relation to mitigation. These central issues did not get their fair share of time at our sixth session in Bonn, and must be addressed here in Lima in addition to adaptation and finance. The discussions that took place in Bonn on adaptation are the kind of exchanges that we need to see on all key issues in relation to the 2015 Agreement. We really have very little time left for a more focused negotiating text to be made available. In October EU leaders endorsed the 2030 climate and energy framework, with a binding headline domestic greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990. The US and China followed by making important announcements in relation to their post 2020 mitigation targets. We look forward to these being translated into transparent, quantifiable and comparable INDCs in the coming 4 months, and for at least all major and emerging economies to come forward with theirs. The EU is already working on its INDC on the basis of information requirements common to the current draft decision annex options such as base year, type of contribution, timeframe, coverage, and methodologies and assumptions. The decision agreed in Lima must allow us all to be on the same page in terms of what is needed. We also note the significant initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund as a result of contributions by EU Member States amounting to more than $3.9 billion as well as contributions by several others, including some developing countries. It is essential that we build on the positive momentum of these recent developments, as well as the UN Secretary General Summit of World Leaders, to secure a good outcome in Lima. In closing we continue to look to the co-Chairs for their guidance and to work with our negotiating partners and the Peruvian COP Presidency in a spirit of constructive engagement. \"',\n",
              "       '\"I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China Mr. Co-Chairs, The objectives of the ADP session in Lima are very clear in accordance with the agreed task from the Warsaw decision and previous decisions. They are, first, the elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text; second, the identification of the information to be provided by Parties when communicating their Intended Nationally Determined Communications, and third, the acceleration of pre-2020 implementation. The decision in Lima must reflect balanced progress in both workstreams, as well as between workstreams. We need to focus on these three core agreed tasks to ensure a successful COP in Lima and to lay a solid foundation for the adoption of the agreement in Paris next year. The Group underlines the importance of making substantial progress on elaboration of the elements for a drafting negotiating text, essential to the adoption of the 2015 agreement in Paris. The Group reiterates that the 2015 agreement must be under the Convention and based on its principles and provisions related to commitments and responsibilities with regard to mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The provisions of the 2015 agreement should focus on enhanced action related to the six core elements. Mr. Co-Chairs, The Group also looks forward to advance negotiations on the information of the intended nationally determined contributions. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions represent the effort each country is willing to make in the global effort to fight climate change, and must be seen in a balanced and comprehensive context pursuant to decisions 1/CP.17, 2/CP.18 and 1/CP.19 in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Developed country Parties shall provide finance, technology transfer and capacity building support. Developing countries will require provision of adequate support for their domestic preparations of their intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon, as well as for the implementation of their enhanced action both before and after 2020. The Group would like to reiterate that decision 1/CP.19 paragraph 2(d) urges developed countries, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and other organizations to provide adequate support to allow for developing countries to undertake their domestic preparations for the intended nationally determined contributions and for submitting information thereon, and for implementing their enhanced action after 2020. It is crucial to provide clarity on the level of financial support that will be provided by developed country Parties to developing country Parties to allow for enhanced implementation of the Convention. Any agreement without Equity and CBDR and RC is not in accordance with the Convention. A protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force that is only mitigation focused and bottom-up will result in developed countries emitting more than they should within a global emission budget to limit warming in this century and will not effectively , address climate change as early as possible. Time is running out - the world cannot afford half-measures or half-commitments with respect to climate actions. The relevant part of the Lima decision should \\' focus on identification of the information, in order to achieve a successful outcome on the information with a view to facilitating the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDCs. Mr. Co-Chairs, Workstream II is an integral part of the ADP and has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. Enhanced pre-2020 ambition will not only provide a strong basis for post-2020 cooperation, but is also necessary to avoid higher costs and risks associated with adaptation and mitigation in the long run. Through WSII, all countries should demonstrate . their political will recognizing that developed countries shall take the lead through enhanced actions on increasing the emission reduction targets to at least 40% by 2020 below 1990 level and providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing country Parties, which, in turn, contributes to greater confidence and trust among Parties in the context of negotiations on the Durban Platform. The work of workstream II should continue until the pre2020 ambition gap is closed. The follow-up arrangements on accelerating the implementation of paragraph 3, 4 and 5 of the Warsaw decision are integral parts of the workplan under WSII. Both the accelerated implementation of paragraph 3 and 4 of the Warsaw Decision and the technical expert meetings should be dealt with in the draft decision in a balanced manner and as a matter of urgency and priority. Mr. Co-Chairs, The group wishes to express its full support toward helping the Co-Chairs secure a successful outcome to these negotiations. In this regard, the group believes that the most promising way forward lies in ensuring that the 2015 agreement treats the elements. of mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building and transparency of action and support in a balanced manner. The group also reiterates the need to secure progress in addressing the issues of Loss and Damage as well as Adverse Impacts of Response Measures in an effective and meaningful manner. We would like to emphasize the importance of all elements of Article 6 of the Convention, which are fundamental for the effective implementation of a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force. Developing skills for new and sustainable jobs, engaging all groups of society, communicating climate science and sharing information on climate change effectively, benefitting from traditional knowledge and indigenous practices for innovative climate action and fostering an informed citizenry are essential aspects for success of such a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force. The Group would like to recall that the objective of the ADP is to enhance action and to promote the full and effective implementation of the Convention through the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime. Any attempts to redefine, rewrite, renegotiate or reinterpret the Convention and its principles and provisions that would result in a watering down or weakening of the Convention will not be acceptable and will only complicate and delay the process. Mr. Co-Chairs, As you yourselves have pointed out, time is not on our side. The G77 and China is concerned about the lack of progress in elaborating the elements , 5 of the 2015 agreement. The work on the text of the elements must be accelerated. This can be accomplished by adopting a mode of work that reflects the principles and provisions of the Convention, focuses on the specific points under the six core elements in a balanced manner and by further fleshing out the elements through Party-driven, targeted and focused negotiations The group is also of the view that trust and confidence can be enhanced by establishing a balance in the progress of discussions of the elements and the information on INDCs. There also needs to be a balance in the treatment of Parties inputs as reflected in neutral, balanced and comprehensive outcome documents. Any streamlining of the options should be based on the consensus among the Parties collectively and constructively, by reflecting Parties\\' views in a comprehensive manner. In closing, Mr. Co-Chairs, The G77 and China envisions a mode of work that builds on areas of commonality, that has a high probability of achieving a meaningful outcome, and that reflects the consensus and ownership by all Parties. The group stands ready to work with you and with our negotiating partners to secure this desired outcome here in Lima as a prelude to the successful completion of our work in Paris next year. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the LDC Group. I would like to associate my statement with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of the African Group and by Nauru on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). Co-chairs, I will address the elements related to both contect and process in my intervention. As indicated by the 5th assessment report of the IPCC, greenhouse gas emissions concentrations in the atmosphere arc now the highest, they have ever been, and are continuing to rise. We have reached a point where we are already experiencing impacts that cannot be reversed. Mr. Co-chairs, is this context, a successful climate deal in Paris must engage Parties in Lima working towards the adoption of a protocol, with most ambitious emission reduction targets, that addresses adaptation, Loss and Damage, means of implantation, transparency of action and support. A successful Protocol in Paris must strengthen our ability as a global community to cope with the inevitable changes we now face, providing in particular effective financial, technical and capacity building support to the most vulnerable countries to cope with climate impacts. We have contributed least to this crisis. Yet we are suffering worst and will continue to do so. We propose followings to be addressed in priorities in Lima: First, we thank you for the second version of The non-paper and we support your approach for this session to have a more in-depth textual negotiation. the non-paper as it stands is reasonably well balanced. We are grateful that you have picked up most of the elements that we proposed in our October submission and we are optimistic that the rest will be accommodated as well. We hope to further define the elements text and formalize it here in Lima. Second, we feel the draft decision on INDC and Pre-2020 ambition needs more clarity. The decision related to INDC must enable the parties to provide information when putting their INDCs forward in the context of the 2015 Protocol. This decision should facilitate parties for domestic preparations, including the information Parties require to submit in their contributions by March 2015 in a transparent and quantifiable manner. It is important that the INDC decision also provides clear provisions to enable upwards adjustments of initial contributions in line with science, so that we can secure a Protocol that ensures the survival of our countries. All Parties must have mitigation components in their INDCs. However, the national circumstances and special needs of LDCs and SIDS will be reflected in their INDCs. Third, we need to focus our discussion on how to accelerate the implementation of pre-2020 climate action, including ratifying the Doha Amendments of the Kyoto Protocol. 1\\'hose countries that must deliver the highest mitigation actions, aiming at closing the mitigation gap, must act fast based on science and to avoid further impacts, Loss and Damage due to climate change. With respect to the process, we are generally comfortable with the approach you have set out. Finally Mr Co-Chairs, we reaffirm that the LDC Group is strongly committed to this process. We believe that we can have successful negotiations in Lima under your strong leadership. Thank you \"',\n",
              "       '\"Cuba is delivering this statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries. We fully associate with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, both the process in the ADP and the substance of what we produce at this session are going to be crucial in shaping what the final outcome will be in Paris. We are deeply concerned about the process within the ADP. Direct negotiations among the Parties did not take place at the October session, and your scenario note indicates that that will also not be the case at this session. We are highly concerned that this process will not move us forward in a Party-driven, transparent and inclusive manner. We expect the mode of work to change from the very first day. We expect to see the Contact Group start direct and interactive negotiations among the Parties. We want to see draft texts from Parties on screen, on paper, being directly negotiated by the Parties with each other through focused negotiating groups around specific points under the six core elements in order to narrow differences, find convergence, and achieve consensus. Various views from Parties should be reflected in a balanced, objective, neutral and comprehensive manner. Any streamlining of the options should be based on the collectively constructed consensus among Parties rather than reflecting Parties\\' views in a selective manner We do not want to lose more time. We expect, at the close of this session, to see the elements for a draft negotiating text to have been elaborated by the ADP. This is our mandate and must be fulfilled. We want to see a solid and robust international outcome implementing the UNFCCC\\'s provisions, principles, and structure. This will enable all countries to solve the climate crisis together in an equitable manner. This international cooperation should see developed countries doing substantially more than what they are doing or planning to do in cutting their emissions. We should also see developed countries fulfill their commitments under the UNFCCC and cooperate more with developing countries, through providing more financial resources, improving access to climate knowledge and technology, helping build skills and capacity, and addressing the adverse social and economics consequences of their response measures, so that developing countries would be able to do more in terms of adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable development as their respective contributions to addressing climate change in a manner that benefits all countries and peoples equitably. The ADP decision in Lima should address balance in the core elements mandated by Durban and focus on the three agreed tasks from Warsaw, i.e., elaboration of the elements, identification of the information and acceleration of the pre-2020 implementation. We emphasize our grave concern over those developed country Parties that are not Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, or do not participate in the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We believe that any attempts by developed country Parties to 1 casually set aside their existing legal commitments while calling for increasing pre-2020 ambition or a new legal agreement seriously questions their sincerity in combating climate change. Unfortunately, your draft ADP decision text falls far short in terms of being balanced and comprehensive. The bottom-up approach based on self-differentiation for all Parties, as proposed by the developed country Parties will not reflect the principle of CBDR, would fail to achieve ambitious and urgent commitments, and represents a clear backsliding on their existing commitments under the Convention. It prioritizes mitigation over all the other elements such as adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building. It paves the way to an outcome that will in essence rewrite and reinterpret the Convention, particularly the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and will eliminate the differentiation between developed and developing country Patties. It downplays the high importance that developing countries attach to seeing adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building be on an equal footing as mitigation and as the basis for their enhanced actions in the 2015 outcome. The same approach can be seen in your non-paper on the elements. This approach will lead to an outcome marked by low ambition and low levels of action. It will be inequitable, unbalanced, and will not bring us closer to solving the climate crisis in a fair manner. For your papers to be considered as among the bases for our negotiations, balance must be first brought into them. This would include, among other things: treating all elements in a balanced manner and with the equal footing , rather than prioritizing mitigation over the others; ensuring that the principle of CBDR as seen in the Convention is fully reflected rather than reinterpreted or rewritten through using the terms \\'evolving\\'; the bottom-up approach can not be the new approach for undertaking commitments by developed country Parties but should be so for the enhanced actions to be undertaken by developing countries; developed countries must substantially ramp up their emission reductions ambition; and the linkage between the provision by developed countries of the finance, technology and capacity building support to developing countries and what developing countries can do in terms of enhanced actions must be made clear. We want to reach an outcome here in Lima and then in Paris that will be equitable and allows us all to work together to solve the climate crisis. We can only do that if the process is open and transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and built on consensus if the substantive content is balanced. As representatives of sovereign States, we wish to negotiate with our partners with dignity and respect in order to achieve consensus. We will not accept being made, due to a mismanaged process, to press around each other in an undemocratic, non-inclusive, and nontransparent \"\"huddle\"\" at the last hours and minutes of the COP just to finalize a decision. We will not accept a situation in which we are forced to consider on a take it or leave it basis an outcome text that we have not negotiated upon, whether in Lima or Paris. This is our responsibility as the representatives of our 3.5 billion peoples. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr. Chairman, I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Member States of the Central American Integration System (SICA) - Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and my country, Belize. SICA aligns itself with the statement made by Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Our region is strongly committed to the achievement of concrete results in the ADP here in Lima and on the road to Paris with the view to fulfill the mandate of the Durban Platform for enhanced Action. SICA members consider that now is the time to move into an open, transparent and inclusive negotiating and focused format among parties. Given the interest we as Governments and our people worldwide have in the success of this process, we must avoid the huddle process which has come to characterize previous COPs. We need to act with urgency to deliver upon the mandate of the ADP. SICA wishes to signal our expectations for the ADP decisions in Lima. Overview SICA calls on all Parties to work constructively on all the elements for a balanced draft negotiating text and the work regarding information on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions as well as on the work-plan for enhancing mitigation ambition to achieve the 1.5 degree and help close the pre-2020 ambition gap, particularly by developed countries. Revised JF As an overarching consideration, SICA Member States underscore the centrality of the principles and provisions of the Convention, including, equity and Common but Differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and the most recent scientific evidence, in the I PCC fifth Assessment Synthesis Report in the execution of the ADP mandate. These are the foundation upon which we should elaborate an ambitious, durable and effective agreement that will promote the participation of all parties in the fulfillment of the ultimate objective of the Convention. Expectations for the 2015 Agreement Within that agreement, SICA Member States underscore that adaptation needs to be strengthened and the Adaptation Committee should be anchored therein. All the six elements identified in the ADP mandate should be reflected in a balanced and meaningful way in the agreement, including the transparency of action and support. We also wish to underscore the importance of all elements of Article 6, which are fundamental for the effective implementation of the 2015 agreement, including developing skills for new and sustainable jobs, engaging all groups of society, communicating climate science and sharing information on climate change effectively, benefiting from traditional knowledge and indigenous practices for innovative climate actions effectively. Expectations for INDCs With respect to INDCs, we stress the need to include all the elements of the ADP mandate. Further, we consider that the required information to be submitted should be based on the provisions of the convention and relevant decisions and may have different modalities as per the national circumstances and capacities on different issues. Expectations for Finance On finance, we must have clear commitments, and clarity on how scaling up the mobilization of 100 billion USO per year by 2020 to assist 2 Revised JF developing countries in both adaption and mitigation is going to be accomplished. Expectations on process Finally, given that we have decided that the ADP is intended to produce a protocol, other legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force, we must initiate discussions on the issues that would arise from a legally binding agreement that includes the legal implications of the different elements. We support the call for consideration of the establishment a mechanism at the proper time that will consider legal aspects of such an agreement that have yet to be addressed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries: Canada, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the United States and Australia. Umbrella Group countries are determined to successfully adopt an ambitious new global climate change agreement, applicable to all, in Paris. We are committed to implementing our commitments up to 2020. We will also explore cooperative ways to enhance practical climate action, including by working with business, civil society and others. We recognise the significance of this meeting in paving the way for success in Paris. Here in Lima, we must deliver a COP decision that provides the clear guidance countries need to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions toward mitigating climate change well in advance of Paris. Transparent, understandable and quantifiable emission reduction efforts are critical to building collective confidence and understanding how we are tracking globally. We must have guidance on this ahead of the agreed timetable for tabling iNDCs. Here in Lima, we must also further elaborate the elements for a draft negotiating text. Elements that are balanced, concise and based on areas of convergence will serve as a guide when we move into formal negotiations on the agreement text next year. Significant work will be needed to achieve this. Umbrella Group countries will be offering our suggestions on how to bring the current version of your non-paper in line with these objectives. We recognise the political priority for the Paris agreement to address mitigation, adaptation and support. But doing so will require addressing each issue according to its unique characteristics, while ensuring that the agreement remains focused on enhancing mitigation ambition and achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention. Umbrella Group countries also emphasise the importance of developing a common transparency and accountability framework to support the agreement, including rules for the land sector and markets. We must keep an overall view of the structure of the agreement, and identify which elements will need to be constant and durable, and which are dynamic and therefore are better dealt with through evolving decisions. For this reason, it is essential that we do not splinter our discussions into fragmented workstreams, but ensure our mode of work lets us bring the structure and form of the elements non-papear together in a coherent way. Here in Lima, we want to have periodic opportunities to come together as a group between parallel elements discussions for this reason. Co-Chairs, The ADP has done important practical work over the last year on enhancing pre2020 mitigation ambition. The value of the technical meetings has been widely acknowledged, as has the value of a cooperative approach that involves a broad set of actors from international and regional organisations, sub-national entities and the private sector. Umbrella Group countries strongly support this work and want to see it continue. Here in Lima, we seek a decision that will do just that. We do not see it being helpful to shift the focus of this workstream from cooperative collaboration, towards an implementation review that duplicates processes already happening elsewhere under the UNFCCC. Co-Chairs, There is much to do. And we are ever mindful of how short our time is. We are confident in your leadership, and assure you, and all Parties, of our commitment to securing strong ADP outcomes here in Lima. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Our expectations and why the new Decision text is not satisfactory and cannot be accepted by us. We had a few key points that are essential for us (red lines). Unfortunately we find that the new text does not address any of our key points adequately. This includes affirming that this text is operating under the principles of the Convention especially equity and CBDR, differentiation between Annex 1 and non Annex 1 in INDCs is recognised and operationalised, no introduction of new terms such as \\x1cother parties in a position to do so\\x1d or \\x1cwilling to do so\\x1d, which undermines the differentiation, and which are not terms or concepts agreed in the Convention, The scope of the INDCs includes all the elements\\x14mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology, capacity building, transparency. It should not be mitigation centric. In particular, there has to be parallel information on finance contributions which is required to support the developing countries\\x19 contributions on mitigation and other climate actions, the contents of the Decision will not prejudge the terms and content of the 2015 agreement. There should not be activities on assessment of the INDCs in 2015 (ex ante assessment) and a process of assessment can be considered after 2015 on terms to be agreed to. In the process to build the negotiating text for the 2015 agreement, the submissions of Parties are crucial components that will be drawn on. We have provided a lot of ideas and then a lot of textual language on the above as well as other points. However we are disappointed that our points are not taken on board in the new text. For example: The CBDR and other principles of Convention are not adequately recognised and especially not operationalised. There is no recognition of CBDR or differentiation relating to INDCs and information to be submitted on INDCs. Terms such as ??other countries willing to do so?? are introduced. The finance issue is inadequately treated in the text with no requirement for developed countries to provide information on their finance contributions. The text is mitigation centric. The draft Decision is pre-judging the core elements of the Paris agreement. This is because of the above factors, including the absence of differentiation, the establishment of a mandatory system of mitigation in the text, and the lack of finance commitment in the text. There are activities on assessment in 2015, such as a workshop and Secretariat paper. Para 4 elevates the co chairs?? elements non paper to be the basis of continuing the work on elements, even though it has no legal status, and there has been little discussion on it, while the views and submissions of Parties are not mentioned. We have several other points including on the pre 2020 workstream. We are ready\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, The Republic of the Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. The African Group associates itself with the statement made by the Republic of South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Let me at the outset congratulate you for your election and reiterate the Group\\x19s full support to a successful completion of your mandate. The Group also likes to thank the Government of Switzerland for hosting the meeting in the beautiful city of Geneva, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for the good arrangements made. Co-chairs, Time is running out in producing a draft negotiation text before May 2015, as agreed in Lima. The next 6 days shall be our unique opportunity to advance our work the Group makes the following comments: 3 on the organization of work and 6 on the Substance of the Draft Element Text: On Organization of Work FIRST: In streamlining, parties shall have the flexibility to draw from their own positions and not exclusively the draft element text. However, Co-chairs, as custodians of the Text and process, be aware that insertions and proposals explicitly contradicting either in spirit, or literally, any fundamental principles or provision of the Convention such as Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) in Article 4 and Equity in Article 3, as this would only delay and protract our work and not lead us to any constructive engagement. The Africa group believe that the ADP negotiations are aimed at achieving an agreement with legal force that strength the current multilateral rules-based regime. Therefore our work should be under and guided by the principles and provisions of the Convention and all elements should be treated in a balancer manner. SECOND: In the formation of focused groups and the identification of their mandate, a transparent selection of facilitators in contact with their respective sub-groups is warranted. In addition an inclusive approach to the participation of the focused groups should be followed. Also clarity on the work and the outcomes to the extent possible should be made. Finally the identification of elements to be either included in the Draft Negotiation text or complementary decisions at this point should be cautioned as this might distract us from our mandate of producing a Draft Negotiation by end of next week. THIRD: On scheduling ? Co-Chairs \\x13 We call on you : To explore possibilities of ending the meetings at 6 pm to allow time for Group\\x19s coordination meetings, and; To Ensure that the text to be taken forward is circulated to all parties well before the end of the meeting to allow for the parties endorsement Co-chairs, On points of Substance FIRST: addressing adaptation is not only a sovereign responsibility but a global obligation as well. Legal obligations are established in Convention Articles 2 and 4, in particular articles 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9. A fair outcome for Africa is a meaningful reflection of adaptation support commitments from developed countries. It is a fact that 2degree warming will already pose grave risks to agricultural production and other livelihoods systems across the African continent, putting lives of people at risk, and will require significant adaptation efforts. As part of the elements of the agreement we expect the inclusion of temperature goal, associated emission reduction goals, adaptation goal, with its associated finance and technology support. The global goal for adaptation is a mechanism to recognize the global responsibility and obligatory nature of adaptation to the international community. Loss and damage represents impacts of climate change that are not addressed by mitigation and adaptation and which require a different set of tools to address and should therefore be given its own section in the agreement. The Warsaw international mechanism should be anchored in the new agreement and fully operationalised to ensure that developing countries are provided with support ? including finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building to address loss and damage. SECOND: On Finance - the Paris Agreement should deal with the current gaps and ensure the full inclusion of the following elements: Clear principles that guides the provisions of finance from developed countries to developing countries, in line with the responsibilities clearly identified under the Convention and other relevant decisions (2) Clear quantified targets that link the level of support to the temperature target and stresses on the linkage of actions of developing countries and support provided to them and in line with their needs a\"\" identified by them, with a process to regularly review and update the level of support to be provided to developing countries. Anchoring the existing financial mechanism and existing funds including the Adaptation fund as part of the delivery channels, Clarifying the sources of finance and allowing for transparency and MRV of financial flows from developed country parties to developing countries, Operationalizing agreed criteria of new and additional, predictable, sustainable, adequate and burden sharing criteria among developed countries.

              "       '\"Thank you, Mr. Co-?\\x10Chair, I have the honor to speak on behalf of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean \\x13 AILAC. Allow me to begin by associating ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chair, AILAC warmly welcomes and congratulates you on your appointment as the new ADP Co-Chair. We trust that you will draw upon your extensive and esteemed experience to guide our discussions during this crucial year of the negotiations. AILAC would like to congratulate the Peruvian presidency for the advances made in Lima under their leadership. At COP20 we achieved all tasks that had been set out for us, specifically: We acknowledged the progress made in elaborating the elements for a draft negotiating text that are annexed to decision 1/CP.20. By doing so, Lima succeeded in setting us on track for an ambitious Paris Agreement this year, by providing us with this elaborate basis for our negotiations; We identified the information for parties to provide when communicating their intended nationally determined contributions, in order to provide transparency, clarity and understanding, a critical step to be able to aggregate the contributions and assess our global efforts to reach the 2-degree goal; In Lima we also decided on the continuation of our work on enhancing pre-?\\x102020 mitigation ambition under workstream 2 beyond 2015; which needs to play a significant role in closing the 8-?\\x1010 Gt CO2e emissions gap that remains between emissions levels consistent with the 2-degree target and expected emissions levels if existing pledges are implemented. The GCF\\x19s initial capitalization reached over USD 10 billion; with groundbreaking participation from a number of members of AILAC. These are remarkable achievements that must be highlighted. Yet, much remains to be done in order to reach our common goal of having an ambitious, effective and robust 2015 Agreement in Paris. Time is pressing and we need to start without delay here in Geneva to continue our negotiations on the elements that AILAC considers to be priorities, such as the giving political parity to adaptation, establishing clear rules for mitigation, scaling up of finance for climate action, and the design of a durable architecture for commitment cycles. Co-Chair, It is AILAC\\x19s belief that it can be of benefit to our negotiations if we can agree at this ADP session to a clear and transparent method for streamlining the texts we are collectively working on. We are grateful for the Scenario Note produced by the Co-Chair, which fosters transparency, inclusiveness and openness to input from the Parties. It is also important to learn from our recent experience, and immediately start work on the basis of the annex of the Lima Call for Climate Action, with focused negotiations under the ADP contact group. We believe it is critically important that the 2015 Agreement address in a balanced manner mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The Agreement should include collective goals on these three issues, in order to provide a shared sense of direction to our global efforts to enhance climate change actions. We expect all Parties to come forward with ambitious and aggregable mit\"',\n",

I speak on behalf of the following members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) Cuba, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. We join the interventions made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and Bolivia by the Group of Like-Thinking Developing Countries (LMDC). Our countries have been committed at the highest level of Government to reach a just and necessary agreement to save Mother Earth, and therefore they wish to make the following points: Since the Copenhagen Conference we have added our voices to that of the peoples of the world regarding the need not to change the climate, but to change the unjust system that promotes unsustainable models of production and consumption, the excessive accumulation of capital, the exhaustion of natural resources beyond the biophysical limits of the planet. It does not stop us worrying that it has been precisely developed countries that have demonstrated an alarming level of non-compliance and ignorance of their obligations not only of mitigation, but also in the provision of financing, technology transfer and capacity to developing countries, in the current legal climate change regime, which makes it difficult for us to start this process with overly optimistic expectations. It is necessary to raise the moral level of the debate to achieve the ambition that the world requires to overcome the systemic crises in which we find ourselves immersed. Ethical action is essential just 10 months after the Paris Conference. It is irrational and unfair to try to impose that developing countries are the ones that should cover the default quotas of those countries with historical responsibilities in origin and acceleration of this problem. The right to sustainable development should not be curtailed to our peoples, who are the ones who suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, and the right is the responsibility of all countries to achieve the eradication of poverty, in all its dimensions. The future agreement may not be based on the continuation of false promises or false solutions that reissue the causes that have generated the problem. Ladies and Gentlemen Co-Presidents, it is necessary to guarantee an inclusive and transparent process of negotiations, led by the States, for the well-being of the process that will take us to Paris. Ways should be found for the negotiating text to reflect the views of the Parties in an equitable and balanced way based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Negotiations must make it possible to strengthen the current commitments of the Kyoto Protocol and achieve in Paris to complement and improve the climate regime with an ambitious agreement based on the Convention, its principles and objectives. \"',\n",

I would like to associate with the statement delivered by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chair, At the outset, let me thank you for taking on this challenging task in what is a critical year in the international effort to address climate change. In the past few weeks alone, scientists have confirmed that 2014 was the hottest year on record and that sea level rise is accelerating more drastically than previously believed\\x14underscoring the urgency of the challenge before us, particularly for our members, whose very survival is at stake. Needless to say, it is absolutely essential that we make substantive progress this week and that we avoid squandering our limited time on procedural matters. Co-Chair, We are prepared to progress our discussions based on the elements for a draft negotiating text contained in the Annex of the Lima decision. Building trust towards Paris will require that there are no surprises in our mode of work or the outputs of our negotiations. In this regard, we welcome your assurances that the negotiating text will be drafted in an open and transparent manner and will reflect the contributions of all parties. We also welcome your assurance that parties will have the opportunity to review the manner in which our inputs have been captured before this session in Geneva is closed as well as the opportunity to further engage on the negotiating text and the issues raised at subsequent sessions.

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs At the outset we wish to convey our congratulations for your appointment as ADP cochairs and express our support to you in the extremely important task of guiding Parties towards consensus. We believe that the Lima COP has been an important milestone for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of the 2015 agreement, by providing us with the elements for a draft negotiating text and agreeing on information to be presented along with the intended nationally determined contributions. The \\x18Lima Call for Climate Action\\x19 clearly underlines that the 2015 outcome should be under the Convention and be guided by its principles and provisions. The elements for a draft negotiating text provide a good starting point for this year. We express our strong desire to make further progress during this session, by making balanced progress both between the two work streams and among the six mandated elements of the 2015 agreement under the Durban Platform. The BASIC countries believe that achieving consensus requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention, in full accordance with its principles and provisions. The Paris agreement should enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, not create a new regime or restructure, reinterpret or rewrite the Convention. Co-Chairs We have before us the complex task of translating the elements text into a draft negotiating text before May 2015. The ADP should immediately enter a real negotiation that is open and transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensusbuilding. In order to do so, it is the view of the group that we must advance on the elements mandated in Durban, in a balanced manner and coherent structure. Coherence is also fundamental to address cross-cutting issues in all sections of the negotiating text, in particular differentiation between developed and developing countries and the application of the principles of equity and CBDR &RC. In this regard, BASIC countries would like to underline our view that the so-called ??self differentiation?? approach is not consistent with the Convention, nor with the Durban mandate or the Lima Call for Climate Action. The 2015 agreement is a vehicle to enhance the implementation of commitments in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention. This requires honoring and implementing existing commitments and responsibilities by developed countries. Enhanced action will not be achieved by shifting these to developing countries. Co-Chairs, Regarding the pre-2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-2020 mitigation ambition and call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period. We note with concern that the pre-2020 ambition ga\"',\n",

We associate this statement with those delivered on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, and on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, we congratulate you on your election and thank you for undertaking the task of leading us to the finalization of a comprehensive and ambitious international legally binding agreement applicable to all. The agreement\\x19s ambition must be largely science-driven; and, as such, it must be commensurate with the evidence of the growing magnitude of the adverse impacts of climate change and the increasing potential of dangerous climate change. As we have contended since the inception of this process, the adequacy of the global response should be measured against the benchmark of what is needed to ensure the survival of small island and low-lying developing states. We therefore insist upon a holistic approach in the agreement that : Defines what we shall undertake in order to contain global warming to as far as possible below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; Provides for comprehensive action, including the establishment or strengthening of effective mechanisms, to meet adaptation needs especially of the SIDS; Anchors the commitment to effectively address Loss and Damage as a specific objective in the agreement; Provides for the anchoring and implementation of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework; and, Articulates concrete commitments to achieve the adequate scale, additionality, predictability and transparency for sustained climate finance and to make readily available technology and capacity building to support the full and effective implementation of the agreement as a whole, taking into account, at the same time, the particular challenges SIDS face in accessing finance and technology. A critical preliminary step to advancing this approach is the submission of iNDCs so that an assessment can be made to evaluate the effect of all the pledges to limit global warming, as well as the potential related consequences for adaptation. CARICOM is committed to working to meet the deadline for these submissions. We welcome your initiative to convene a session on support available for preparation of INDCs. Because of the slow response of the climate system to emissions, and the need to undertake reassessments of the mitigation efforts, we consider that the pledging cycles should be no longer than five years. The world should not tie itself down to a target that condemns our most vulnerable countries to permanent loss and damage and possibly extinction. Co-chairs, we appreciate the indicative schedule you have provided us but wish to draw your attention to two issues. You have included Loss and Damage as an appendage to Adaptation. These are separate issues and require, likewise, separate treatment. We therefore request the setting aside of time to consider Loss and Damage as a stand-alone issue. Secondly, we must address legal form and welcome dedicating at least an evening session for this purpose. We maintain, as do many othe\"',\n",

Mr. Co-chair, at the outset we would like express our gratitude and appreciation for the work conducted by both your predecessors. We thank them for their leadership and guidance, which we believe set us on the right path to achieve an agreement in Paris. We are sure that you will be able to keep the bar high and lead us toward a successful outcome in Paris at the end of the year. Mr. Co-chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chair our Coalition came to Lima well prepared and determined to move the process forward and build on the success of previous years. In particular, we all recognize the vital role rainforests play related to both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C will be unfulfilled without the contribution of rainforests. This concept is not fully nor properly reflected in the draft negotiating text that was issued at COP-20 in Lima. After the successful adoption of the Warsaw REDD+ Framework in 2013, rainforest nations are now ready to implement REDD+ actions on the ground. This is strictly conditional upon adequate and predictable financial and technological support and capacity building. Mr. Co-Chair, with respect to REDD+ finance, we believe that a new market-based mechanism including REDD+ should be established. We must also acknowledge the necessity for an operational link between the REDD Plus logical framework of the Green Climate Fund and the Warsaw Framework for REDD+. Support for REDD+ actions to developing countries provided under and outside the Convention should be properly coordinated following the guidance provided by the Annual Meeting of REDD+ national entities as per decision 10/CP.19. Mr. Co-chair, we therefore reiterate the fundamental role of REDD+ in closing the \"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland.  We would first like to thank the Peruvian presidency for the excellent manner, in which they conducted the conference in Lima in December and would like to express our support to the incoming French presidency for the months to come and a successful outcome of the COP in Paris.  Mr. Co-chairs, we all know, how important this year is. The outcome of Paris needs to be a legally binding instrument containing the enduring elements of the 2015 Agreement, COP decisions with dynamic and technical elements, and NDCs for the period from 2020. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement needs to address all relevant areas: mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency of action and support. We hope to leave Geneva with not only a negotiation text that is acceptable as a basis for the further negotiations by all but also a text which is further streamlined and makes clear which elements should be addressed in the agreement and which in COP decisions.  In our view, Parties already had the chance in Lima to propose text they want to see reflected in the paper. We are happy to see the proposals made in Lima in the text but are of the view, that here in Geneva we need to start shortening and streamlining the text.  In the area of Mitigation, we need to ensure that in Paris we will be able to anchor fair and ambitious NDCs. In Warsaw and Lima, Parties have agreed to prepare INDCs and communicate them well in advance of COP21 and by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so, including up-front information. I like to reiterate here, that all EIG Parties are sincerely engaged in domestic preparations of their INDCs and are strongly committed to their timely communication ahead of COP21 including the accompanying up-front 2 information as decided in Lima. We would welcome the possibility that Parties that have submitted their INDCs before June would have the opportunity, if they wish to do so, to present them and receive reactions from other country Parties in the spirit of learning and mutual understanding.  Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement must be based on one common set of rules applicable to all Parties but at different depths in terms of type, stringency and timing among other in order to account for different national circumstances and capacities. Such a rules based system is of utmost importance in order to ensure transparency, comparability and mutual understanding.  Adaptation must be a major component of the 2015 Agreement and should be addressed with the same level of priority. In our view, the development and implementation of adaptation plans and strategies is central in order to build resilience and minimize and cope with the adverse effects of climate change. For means of implementation, the new agreement needs to ensure that all developed country Parties and other Parties in a position to do so, provide enhanced, effective and transparent support for country-driven mitigation and adaptation actions in countries which need such support.  Mr. Co-Chairs, we have less than one year for the 2015 Agreement to become what we want it to be: a fair and ambitious legally-binding rules-based climate change agreement applicable to all Parties, taking into account CBDR/RC and equity and mutually supportive with human rights, gender equality and health policies.  The time we have left up to Paris is short and we have to work hard and focus on common ground, not on differences. We therefore fully support your suggested organization of work and especially to move to the next session after the allocated time and allow for the remaining interventions later in the week and support time limited break out groups to deepen or solve specific open issues.  We have the aim to leave Geneva with a streamlined negotiating text as well as a text for a possible COP draft decision accompanying the agreement. Therefore we would support you, the Co-chairs, to produce, if necessary, a clean draft on the basis of the discussions during this week and in the sense of 3 the ADP decision in Lima by May this year. Here in Geneva, we are ready to only make proposals if we want to bring in an idea that is not yet captured in the text but most importantly, proposals to streamline or replace existing text.  Last but not least, we would like to express our full support to you, the new Co-chairs of the ADP. We are looking forward to work with you throughout this important year and towards a successful outcome in Paris in December. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We would like to welcome the new Co-Chairs. We endorse the approach outlined by them in their scenario note \\x13 in particular on the need to work towards a comprehensive, and streamlined negotiating text by the end of this week. We expect the Co-Chairs to guide and lead us towards that outcome and they have the full support of the EU to do so. We have come to Geneva with a clear objective of working towards adopting a legally binding agreement at COP 21 that is capable of keeping us collectively on track to achieve the below 2?C objective. In that context it is important that we make progress this week on several issues, and on four issues in particular. Firstly, on how to ensure dynamism in the 2015 Agreement through the regular review of mitigation ambition. Secondly, how the 2015 Agreement will deliver transparency and accountability of Parties\\' against the mitigation commitments they will make in Paris. Thirdly ensuring that the 2015 Agreement delivers climate resilience through effective adaptation, and to further consider how the post 2020 regime will provide climate finance to those countries in need. We welcome in particular the initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund. Finally progress has to be made also towards enhancing mitigation before 2020. It is critically important for all Parties to come forward with ambitious INDCs. The EU will come forward with its INDC in the f\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished representatives, Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. First of all, we wish to congratulate you on your election as our Co-Chairs. I also wish to thank the Government of Switzerland for hosting this important meeting. The Group wishes to express its full support toward helping the Co-Chairs . guide us to a successful outcome to these negotiations. The Group of 77 and China represents about 85% of the world\\'s population. Our peoples suffer the effects of climate change first hand. Climate change threatens not only the development prospects of developing countries and their achievement of sustainable development but also the very existence and 1 survival of countries, societies and the ecosystems of our Mother Earth. You can therefore be assured of the group\\'s commitment to this process as we recognise the importance of a successful outcome in Paris. It is our expectation that the process leading up to Paris should be open, transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensus-building in order to arrive at a comprehensive, balanced and equitable outcome. More than two-thirds of the UNFCCC Parties are members of our Group. The Group .also encompasses at least 10 subgroups and our strength emanates from this diversity. There can be no meaningful and legitimate agreement if the concerns of the Group of 77 and China are not taken into account. We would like to recall that the objective of the APP is to enhance action and to promote the fl.Ill and effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention. Any attempts to redefine, rewrite, renegotiate or reinterpret the Convention and its principles and provisions that would result in a watering down or weakening of the Convention will not be acceptable and will only complicate and delay the process. The tasks of the ADP session here in Geneva are very clear in light of the decisions we have all committed ourselves to since Durban. Before turning to the key issues to be addressed in the agreement, we note that the current Elements , paper annexed to the Lima decision was not, due to time limitations, fully negotiated in Lima. This Elements paper is an expression of multiple views which must be considered in light of the decisions adopted in Lima. We agreed on timelines for our work, namely that we need to . complete the work of the ADP as early as possible in order to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties at the Paris COP. We also agreed that the ADP must make available a negotiating text before May 2015. We therefore support your determination to deliver a draft negotiating text by Friday. In order to deliver on this task, trust and mutual reassurances from all Parties, as well as the necessary political will and determination to find solutions for key issues, are essential. Any streamlining of the options should be based on consensus among Parties collectively and constructively, with Parties\\' views to be reflected in a balanced and comprehensive manner in the negotiating text. Co-Chairs, Under Workstream I, the Group reiterates that the 2015 agreement must be under the Convention, applicable to all Parties and based on its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Any agreement without equity and CBDR&RC is not in accordance with the Convention. We also decided that the 2015 agreement must be comprehensive in dealing with all the agreed elements, inter alia mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building and transparency of action and support required from developed to 4 developing countries, in a balanced manner. The Group also ?reiterates the crucial importance of appropriately, effectively and meaningfully addressing adaptation, finance and the need to secure progress in addressing the issue of loss and damage in the 2015 agreement. Other issues such as the adverse impacts of response measures and anchoring specific implementation mechanisms and frameworks in the 2015 Agreement should be addressed. The 2015 outcome should provide for enhanced financial and technological support from developed to developing countries for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions after 2020, especially to those developing countries that . are particular vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. These are fundamental prerequisites\\' for enabling developing countries\\' actions to address climate change and its impacts. Co-Chairs, The Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP that has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. The work of Workstream If should continue until the pre-2020 5 ambition gap is closed. Enhanced pre-2020 ambition will not ?? only provide a strong basis for post-2020 cooperation, but is also necessary to avoid higher costs and risks associated with adaptation and mitigation in the long run. Through Workstream II, we must work with the objective that countries increase mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period, and developed countries must take the lead; through enhanced actions, increasing emission reduction targets to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and the level of ambition on providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to assist developing country Parties in achieving the pledges that they have made. Workstream II is essentially about accelerating the implementation of existing commitments and ways to promote enhanced ambition. The?? speedy ratification of the Doha Amendment would be an impo\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, colleagues, Angola has the honour to speak on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group. At the outset allow me join others in congratulating you both on the appointment as the ADP Co-Chairs. LDCs stand ready to offer you our full cooperation this year, which is one? of the most crucial in the history of the international climate change negotiation process. I would like to associate my group with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China, by Sudan on behalf of African Group of Negotiation (AGN), and by the Maldives on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). Co-Chairs, we are at a critical juncture of our work towards reaching an agreement on a legal text for adoption in Paris. We only have six days to progress from the elements for a draft negotiation text we elaborated in Lima as Annex to Decision 1/CP.20 to a legal and formal negotiating text to be communicated to all Parties in all the United Nations official languages by the end of May. We all understand how important it is to respect this legal requirement and we should endeavor to do so, even if the Lima COP set significant challenges for us. We L\\'DCs are ready to rise to this challenge. I would like to highlight a few key issues that should guide us in our deliberations for the next 6 days. First we believe that we should be working towards a protocol with legal , force to be made available to our leaders for signature at the Paris COP. Second, the new legal agreement should be firmly linked to the most recent science. We must be ambitious and brave in our efforts to ensure an increase in mean global temperatures of no more than 1.5 degree Celsius and fulfill the objective of the UNFCCC. Our collective efforts must recognize that the livelihood of people in the most vulnerable countries depends on an ambitious outcome, one at the scale of the challenge that we are currently facing. Worse is even to be expected, if we do not act with the greatest urgent. We cannot rely on simple pledges. We need strong commitments. Third, we believe that the legal text we develop should give balance to all the major elements arising from the Durban mandate and beyond, and ensure that actions in each of these take into account gender dimensions. A balanced text as the main outcome within a package covering all elements is critical for LDCs. We firmly believe that means of \\'implementation and adaptation are core elements of the Protocol. Forth, to ensure that all Parties take significant steps to reduce their emissions, we must ensure that ??there is new, additional and substantial finance to underwrite this effort. The new protocol should establish durable measures to ensure permanent arrangements for scaling up finance. Fifth, as our countries are already suffering from the severe and irreversible impacts of climate change, an effective response to adaptation is essential. The new legal agreement should properly recognize the importance of providing support for adaptation and to establish new and more effective institutional arrangements to support this effort. Sixth, as we stated in Lima, loss and damage must be a core element of the legal agreement. Loss and damage must be properly recognized as a standalone element separate from adaptation. This is simply due to the fact that loss and damage is a different concept from adaptation. As such co-chairs let us reiterate ou\"',\n",

We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We congratulate you, Co-Chairs, on your assumption of your tasks. We look forward to working with you in crafting a Party driven outcome in Paris that allows the global community to cooperate and effectively address climate change in a manner that is fully under the Convention and enhances its full, effective and sustained implementation. The global interest must be kept supreme as we also urgently need to protect the integrity of Mother Earth. Just a few weeks after Lima, we wish to highlight that the Lima Call for Climate Action represents and reflects the existence of consensus among the Parties on many aspects of our work under the ADP. In this regard, the elements text needs to be made consistent with the agreements reached in Lima, as in COP20 there was no opportunity to update the Annex after the adoption of the Lima decision. The outcome under the ADP must reflect these agreements, without backsliding or reopening the consensus achieved in that decision, such as: Our work is under the Convention and guided by its principles, provisions, and structure, including the differentiated commitments in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention; The Paris outcome shall reflect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as it is under the Convention. Concepts or approaches such as \\x1cevolving CBDR\\x1d or \\x1cParties in a position to do so\\x1d are not consistent with the Convention and are not acceptable. There has been consensus among Parties in Lima that such concepts shall be removed from the outcomes of the COP; It must address in a balanced manner all elements of paragraph 5 of the Durban decision 1/CP.17 mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building, and transparency of action and support; It shall strengthen adaptation action to address the particular vulnerabilities of developing countries, duly taking into account the relationship between poverty eradication and adaptation actions; Reaffirm the COP\\'s decisions on the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage and make these operational; Developed country Parties shall provide financial, technology transfer and capacity building support consistent with their obligations under the Convention to developing country Parties for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions before and after 2020, especially to Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change; There will be no ex ante review. Parties should address address pre-2020 ambition as matter of priority 2020 ambition as matter of priority through accelerating the implementation of paragraph 3 and 4 of the Warsaw decision. We stress that increasing the level of ambition on pre-2020 mitigation and pre-2020 finance, 2020 finance, technology transfer and capacity building support by developed country Parties must be fully technology transfer and capacity building support by developed country Parties must be fully implemented and operationalized as essential components of the Paris 2015 outcome. implemented and operationalized as essential components of the Paris 2015 outcome. We want to express our concern that since the adoption of Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocolo, only two developed country Parties have ratified the amendment. Evidently, there is a lack of ambition on on the part on the part of developed country Parties. of developed country Parties. This will have direct effects on the necessary relationship between pre and post 2020 commitments. Therefore we call upon the Annex I Parties to the Kyoto between pre and post 2020 commitments. Therefore we call upon the Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to advance the legal process of ratification to ensure the continuation of the multilateral legally binding effect of their mitigation commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Three of every four of the world\\'s poor who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate very four of the world\\'s poor who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change live in the countries that are members of the LMDC.

The pursuit of sustainable development and economic diversification are therefore important to developing countries in fighting climate change. Full consideration must be given to what actions are necessary to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures. In this regard, there is also a need for the Paris impact of the implementation of response measures.

              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. First let us welcome you to the chairmanship. We look forward to you guiding our efforts over the coming week to reach a draft negotiating text. As you have encouraged us to move straight into our work of delivering, by Paris, a new, ambitious, effective and globally applicable climate agreement, we will share briefly our priorities for this session. We are ready, as tasked, to work to deliver a first draft text of the new agreement. It is critical that that this text accurately reflects Parties\\' proposals. Without this, Parties may find it difficult to accept the text as the basis on which to take our work forward. At the same time, we should take opportunities to streamline the text - removing duplication, deleting provisions that have no support, and where possible improving the structure. We should also distinguish content appropriate for a legal agreement - that is durable and universal - from content more appropriate to decisions - that is more detailed, or needs updating overtime. We should steer away from a \\'one size fits all\\' treatment of mitigation, adaptation, support and transparency. Our challenge is to develop provisions for each area in a way that leads to the most effective practical outcomes on the ground. We should give more thought to how the new agreement will interrelate with the Convention and its institutions - ensuring we do not duplicate work that will continue under the Convention post2020, nor pre-empt how this work will evolve. To support our efforts to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention in Article 2, we must progress work on the rules by which countries will account for mitigation efforts, to maintain the transparency and integrity of the agreement. We are cognisant of the decision Parties reached in Lima where we underscored our commitment to reflect the principle of CBDRRC in light of different national circumstances in the Paris \\' Agreement. Neither an extreme of retaining the current fixed binary approach, nor an extreme of no differentiation will be acceptable. We need to look at specific approaches that treat very different national circumstances appropriately, and encourage Parties to regularly increase their ambition and improve their transparency. We also look forward to continuing our work on practical ways to build mitigation ambition. It is this action that will provide ballast to a Paris outcome on the new agreement, and to its implementation. We look forward to working with you and all Parties to make this a productive session. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This is a statement made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We came to Geneva with a clear objective of working towards adopting a legally binding agreement at COP21 that is capable of keeping us collectively on track to achieve the below 2?C objective. In that context we have done the minimum necessary to achieve the task set out by the Lima Call for Climate action. We have prepared a Party owned text to be circulated before May as the basis for our negotiations on the road to Paris. However, the pace of progress needs to radically change if we are to deliver a legally binding agreement in Paris. June will need to produce a text with clear options for Ministers. To achieve that, Parties will need to trust each other and the Co-Chairs. Here in Geneva it proved impossible to even consolidate near identical paragraphs, and as such we now have a text that is over double the length of the Lima text. The mode of work in June cannot be a simple continuation of our approach here in Geneva. In order to enter into real negotiations we need three things: Leadership from the Co-Chairs. We need guidance and homework for Parties ahead of the June session. This should take the form of a reflections note that proactively sets out ideas for how we can ensure that time in June is used effectively to ensure success in Paris. Clarity of process. Organisation of work for June should allow for parallel working under the contact group, addressing key issues in a balanced manner. We would also expect in June to have facilitated, issue specific, time limited groups to take things forward. Engagement in substance. Negotiations in June should be through Party engagement on the basis of text. To get to that point we need a shorter text that preserves the position of Parties. The Secretariat should produce a simple technical analysis of the text to indicate duplications, redundancies and identify paragraphs with similar ideas that could be streamlined.

The African Group fully associates itself with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group 77 and China. As such the African Group would like to emphasise the important commitment to the unity of the G77 and China, and reaffirm the call for a multilateral rules-based system that enhances the implementation of the Convention, recognises the enormous contribution by developing countries going to 2020, and as such, calling on developed countries to scale up their support action in developing countries. Co-chairs, The African Ministers, having met in Cairo on the 05-06 March 2015, outlined a vision for a Paris Agreement that amongst others, Will be under the Convention, and in accordance with its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. Further, enhances the implementation of the Convention and its Annexes, consistent with science and equity, and further enhances a multilateral rules-based system in a balanced and ambitious manner;. Provides parity between mitigation and adaptation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries from the inadequate aggregate of mitigation efforts. Further, the agreement should ensure mitigation ambition keeps the world on track for a global temperature increase that is well below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century; Operationalises the global responsibility for adaptation, through a global goal for adaptation that enhances the implementation of adaptation commitments under the Convention, and recognises adaptation investments by developing countries, adaptation needs and costs including adequacy of support from developed countries; 4. Reaffirms the international obligation for all developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex II to provide climate finance to developing countries as a means to enhancing action towards achieving the objectives of the Convention. In line with the direction from our ministers, we would like to emphasise that the delivery on transparency, clarity on pathways and sources of finance to achieve the USD100 billion by 2020 cannot be seen as part of the Paris package in the context of weakening Annex II Party obligations to provide finance to developing country actions, rather as a trust building undertaking, that we do honour agreements under the Convention. Co-chairs, As a group we reaffirm our commitment to engage constructively, and support you in facilitating our negotiation in an effective and efficient manner, particularly with the limited time available for negotiation before Paris. It is in that spirit that we welcome your scenario note for this session, the envisaged outcome, as well as the mode of work for this session. Having reflected on your suggestions on how to conduct our work, we would like to present our views on your proposals, and how we can effectively and efficiently deliver on the outcomes of this session. We share the envisaged outcomes of this session, and believe that our proposals will assist you in delivering against those objectives. Firstly, we support the mode of work you have proposed where we will have a quick first reading of the Geneva Text, and we believe the document ADP.2015.2 Informal Note by the Secretariat could be useful in that regard. In light of time available, the overlaps and duplications \\x18within\\x19 paragraphs could serve as a good starting point. Secondly, we are of the view that the Secretariat Informal Note further presents overlaps and duplications in other paragraphs and sections. In this regard, our ability to effectively streamline the text depends on having space to understand at least the structure and form of the agreement. We, therefore, encourage you to create that space for the development of that understanding building on the ideas you have presented in Annex II of the scenario note. Thirdly, we note the use of the modality of having a working document whilst keeping the Geneva Text intact, which of course we support for various reasons. Understanding the Geneva Text as being the basis for negotiation, we would therefore foresee a situation where the Geneva text is revised based on streamlining progress being made as captured in the working document. We are weary of the working document becoming the basis of negotiation over time with the pretext that it reflects areas of agreement, whereas concerns of Parties in the Geneva Text become obsolete. Fourthly, with regards to the work of facilitators, we welcome their involvement to help you co-chairs to help us. We are rather concerned by the proposed slots at which the facilitations will take place as these coincide with our coordination times. Coordination help us digest views heard during the negotiation, and adjust our ideas to accommodate other views. We are prepared to work hard and make progress in the negotiation, and we are prepared to work late, as we see the facilitation being critical. Lastly, with regards to Workstream II, the Group believes that space is needed to comprehensively work towards a pre-2020 decision, which we see as a necessary step to build the trust and assurance on the implementation of existing agreements going to 2020. Workstream II of the Durban Platform is of utmost importance to the African Group. Co-chairs, All Parties, attending the African COP in Durban, South Africa, agreed that enhancing mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period is an urgent priority. Increasing ambition requires the following 3 key elements: Urgent leadership from developed countries expressed in increased mitigation and accelerated mobilization of the USD100 billion pledged to support the concrete adaptation and mitigation actions; Full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through the implementation of the outcomes of the Bali Action Plan; Beyond this - increasing ambition will require a substantially scaled-up \\x1cambition agenda\\x1d in the pre-2020 period. As a group, we would see such a decision covering both the facilitation of concrete opportunities and the implementation of existing decisions related to adaptation and means of implementation. Africa is working with all countries within the G77 and China to be able to present a submission that includes a clear structure, focused areas, and specific objectives and activities under one by next Thursday, at the contact group meeting. Co-chairs, We find it appropriate to further expand on the effort to support concrete implementation of renewable energy in Africa, and how it links the negotiation world to the real economy world. Today, the 54 countries of Africa have around 1 billion inhabitants and the continent\\x19s population will grow to around 2 billion by 2050. Ensuring the wellbeing of these people requires, among other things, access to reliable and affordable clean energy. Yet, today as many as 600 million people lack adequate access to such energy. To achieve its full potential, Africa must rapidly scale up access to energy, to meet the needs of an expanding population, while also curbing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to address the threat of climate change which, if left unchecked, will undermine development. Africa has taken international leadership by calling for an ambitious global partnership and support programme for the acceleration of renewable energy access and deployment in all countries. This proposal was endorsed by the African Environment Ministers, in March 2015, and called on the Green Climate Fund, and all partners to support the full operationalization of this Initiative for rapid and massive scaling-up. This effort is envisaged to go beyond traditional initiatives to deploy renewable energy, by seeking to develop a strategic framework that can enable transformation therefore addressing incentives at the demand side, supply side and international level in a holistic way. It recognizes that incremental progress will not be sufficient to achieve energy or climate goals, let alone to achieve both simultaneously. Africa, thus, requires an approach that is truly transformational. Co-chairs, The intention is to support African countries by providing a strategic framework for transformation that links goals for energy access, economic development, social wellbeing and climate change. Investment plans, catering both the Green Climate Fund and other sources, will be developed that reflect both the scale of the challenge and the specificities of each country. To this end, it supports the goals of the UN Climate Convention, and in the short-term, contributes to the expected outcomes of a new 2015 climate agreement. To close the access gap by 2030 and enhance the energy infrastructure of African countries to modern, smart systems conducive to an important share of renewable energy in the longer term will require significant investments. By enabling such investments as early as possible, vast savings will be achieved over time. The missing piece ? leveraging the ??on-switch?? required to spark the uptake of renewables and spur new and ??bankable?? projects ? is enhanced public finance to catalyze new projects, guarantee safe investment conditions for both the private and public sectors over several decades, provide concessional credits for upfront investment, and support fixed costs associated with capacity-building, training and smart grid upgrades. Co-chairs, To address these elements, the Initiative will take place in two phases. Phase 1: Between now and 2020 the Initiative will enable the installation of at least 10,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in the continent. At least $5 billion in public and highly concessional finance between 2016 and 2020, from bilateral, multilateral and other sources, including the Green Climate Fund, will be needed to leverage a further USD15 billion in other investments, for a total investment of at least USD20 billion pre-2020. Phase 2: In the second phase, the initiative will catalyze a major transformation by 203\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you, Mr. Co-President, I am writing to ADP on behalf of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean - AILAC. Co-President, I am pleased to start this intervention with news of great importance to AILAC: we have received as a new member of our group the Republic of Paraguay, another ambitious and constructive country, which shares the spirit of AILAC, and which is now joining the efforts of our group to build bridges, reach consensus, and reach a legally binding agreement, and with legal commitments for all the States Parties, that allow us to effectively face the global challenge of climate change. For AILAC it is an honor to welcome you to Paraguay. Let me start by associating ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, AILAC appreciates your effort in organizing the work for this session, and acknowledges through you the work done by the UNFCCC Secretary in terms of overlaps and duplications in the Geneva text. We trust that both instruments, together with their extensive experience, will be fundamental inputs to guide our discussions in this crucial year for negotiations. AILAC values ??the consistent application of procedural rules and working methodologies that are established based on the scenario note, for an effective exchange between the parties during our sessions, 6. AILAC wishes to congratulate the 38 parties that have communicated their contributions to date, in particular the efforts of Mexico and Gabon, countries that have complied with the first indicative date, including Adaptation and Means of Implementation, which are especially relevance to this process; 7. AILAC member countries wish to confirm their determination to communicate their contributions before October, so that they are considered in the fundamental synthesis report of the secretariat, on the aggregate effect of the contributions. In the same way, we call on all UNFCCC member countries to communicate their contributions as soon as possible. Co-Chairs, we are concerned that the percentage of global emissions covered by INDCs reported to date, as well as the level of ambition of some INDCs, still does not guarantee a consistent trajectory with the objective of limiting the increase in temperature by below 2 or 1.5 ?? C, nor the planet\\'s resilience to the impacts of climate change; Co-Presidents, AILAC wishes to recognize the progress made in Geneva under its leadership, materialized in the \"\"eneva text\"\", which allows us to progress on the basis of the Lima Call for Climate Action, towards a legally binding, ratifiable agreement, applicable to all parts and lasting beyond 2030, to be adopted in Paris. We hope during this session to advance at the same pace and we come prepared to make the most of the 20 days of negotiation that we have left before COP21. Co-Presidents, AILAC has used the comparative tables prepared by the Secretary and our own analyzes of duplications and overlaps, with a view to merging paragraphs and options within the text, in line with the scenario note. In this order of ideas, AILAC recognizes the fundamental value of the progress that can be captured in a working document, marking progress towards the construction of a document produced on time and with the participation of all parties, for its adoption at COP21 in Paris; AILAC considers that our negotiations would benefit if we agree in this ADP session on a clear and transparent method to achieve synthetic and coherent texts as a result of the negotiations. We welcome the Co-Chair Scenario Note promoting transparency, inclusiveness, and openness to input from Parties, including the early appointment of facilitators to support work towards COP21. We invite all parties to work constructively with them towards reducing the text and seeking convergence. Finally, our group considers that it is essential to advance in legal matters related to the form of the future Paris agreement. We must learn from the past, and move forward as soon as possible in explicitly addressing the discussion on legal aspects of the Agreement and in particular on the legally binding nature of the instrument that we are going to adopt at COP21. For this we consider that the creation of a discussion group under the ADP, which addresses these issues, is very useful. Thank you very much.  \"',\n",
              "       '\"This intervention is on behalf of the following members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA): Cuba, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. First, add this intervention to those made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and Iran by the Group of Like-Thinking Developing Countries (LMDC). Since the Copenhagen Conference in 2009, our countries have redoubled their sovereign efforts and actions in the fight against climate change and have committed to the highest level of Government to reach a fair, equitable and science-based agreement that allows effectively implement the principles and norms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to save Mother Earth from the devastating consequences of climate change. ALBA firmly believes that a true solution to reverse the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and its repercussions on the climate must be based on the urgent need to change the system that has caused this global problem and thus be able to remedy the changes that have been generated in the climate. The unsustainable models of production and consumption, the excessive accumulation of capital, the depletion of natural resources are the fundamental causes that put the biophysical limits of the planet at risk. The future agreement cannot be based on the continuation of false promises or false solutions that rewrite the causes that have generated the problem. It is necessary to incorporate into this debate an ethical vision and commitment to Mother Earth to achieve the ambition that the world requires to overcome the systemic crises in which we find ourselves. An ethical approach to the climate change negotiation process is essential, even more so when we are just a few months away from the 21st Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the COP-21 in Paris. The principles should not be reinvented, there is already the fundamental concept of sustainable development. Avoid introducing completely biased and interested concepts that divert attention from the integral transformation towards an equitable, just and sustainable society in harmony with the cycles of nature. This transformation, which must also be fair and equitable instead of deepening current inequities, must necessarily go through the rationalization of unsustainable patterns of production and, particularly, of consumption in the so-called developed countries. Political will to reach an agreement The scientific evidence has already been provided and the countries, regardless of their levels of responsibilities, including the ALBA countries, are already suffering the terrible consequences of climate change. The least responsible countries have been the most affected and we are now the least likely to live if current global GHG emissions patterns are maintained. The main difficulty in making decisive progress in combating global climate change continues to be the lack of political will of developed countries to act in accordance with the historic responsibility recognized by the Convention. ALBA is committed to reaching an agreement that will enter into force in the year 2020 to limit greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize below 1.5 ? C, considering that COP-21 in Paris is the space in which the Parties must achieve this objective. The provisions of the future agreement The entire multilateral negotiation process must be open, inclusive and transparent, with full respect for the principle of equality between States. The agreement to be reached in Paris must be an agreement to reinforce the current climate change regime: the Framework Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, not to replace it. This is a process framed in the Convention and therefore must contemplate its principles and provisions. Sustainable development is the universal reference for these discussions, which cannot be confused with other new terms that detract from the evolution of this concept. Another substantial element of the new agreement is differentiation based on the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), recognized by the Convention. Not all countries have the same responsibilities because not all countries have contributed the same amount of GHG emissions, that not all countries have had the same level of compliance in limiting these emissions, and that atmospheric space does not it is being used equitably. The new agreement within the framework of the Climate Change Convention must contemplate a system with fair rules for developing and vulnerable countries to climate change, which includes national priorities such as the eradication of poverty and our right to sustainable development. Why adaptation is a key issue in the future agreement Adaptation to climate change is a central issue in the future international climate regime, taking into account the high vulnerability of developing countries. In this context, it is urgent that developed countries provide the necessary financial resources so that the Adaptation Fund of the Convention remains operational and for the implementation of the Green Climate Fund Nationally Determined Expected Contributions (INDC) It is irrational and unfair to try to impose that developing countries are the ones that must cover the default quotas of those countries with historical responsibilities in the origin and acceleration of the problem of global warming of the planet. The right to development must not be curtailed sustainable development of our peoples, who suffer most from the consequences of climate change and the right and responsibility of all countries to achieve the eradication of poverty, in all its multiple dimensions. Mitigation must be oriented in a legal sense and international responsibility. Not all countries are currently carrying out their obligations under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and this damages the right to development of other countries and even fundamental human rights to life, health, food, to develop in a healthy environment. There is a need for a binding mitigation agreement based on justice and equity, the principles of the Convention and historical responsibilities. Those responsible for climate change must commit to reducing their emissions and providing the means for other countries to reduce them on a voluntary basis, without affecting their possibilities and their right to development. It is unquestionable that developing countries are voluntarily making more contributions in the pre-2020 period than developed countries. The fulfillment by the developed parties of the historical commitments assumed in the framework of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol is essential and, therefore, INDCs must be associated with Article 4 of the Convention where the distinctions regarding obligations are identified of the countries. ALBA countries note with concern that the issue of INDCs is intended to become the central issue in the negotiation and this should not be the case. The negotiation must have a comprehensive and holistic vision in relation to climate change that will allow developing countries to have the endorsement and / or support that allows them to undertake a responsibility of these dimensions. INDCs are only one of the elements of the agreement. For developing countries they should be considered on a voluntary basis, with a comprehensive approach and according to the national circumstances of each country. Taking into account that they are contributions to achieve the objective of the Convention, they should cover all its elements, not only the scope of mitigation. They must understand the adaptation, needs and priorities of developing sectors at the national level, the eradication of poverty. INDCs by themselves will not allow the global goal of 1.5 to be reached, but are accompanied by means of implementation. There is a reference element that constitutes an antecedent for this process, the commitments (pledges) of the countries that assumed the \\x1cCopenhagen agreement\\x1d as binding, were made at COP-16 in Cancun, one year after \\x1cTake note \\x1dOf the Copenhagen agreement. Decision 1.CP / 15 was adopted and then the accession of the countries was promoted through their pledges. The means of implementation For the validity of a future agreement it is essential that the means of implementation be considered, this will allow all countries to be able to be part of an agreement that provides them with the means to make their reduction and / or reduction commitments plausible. emission avoidance and adaptation. Therefore, a feasible agreement must include in a balanced way the following elements: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation (financing, technology transfer and capacity building) that allow reaching the means to make mitigation and adaptation actions feasible. The financing issue is undoubtedly one of the most important, which must be channeled through the bodies created within the framework of the Convention. Increased participation of developing countries in global emissions reduction efforts must be commensurate with the existence of a real framework of new, additional and predictable financial resource flows that developed countries must provide. Adaptation is a fundamental priority for developing countries and, therefore, it is also an obligation for developed countries to finance adaptation actions. Financing must be for mitigation and adaptation. Technology and support that enables the renovation of more efficient and less environmentally damaging technology parks are also a priority for developing countries. It is important that technology transfer does not become a technology market or a way to deepen technological dependency. Technology transfer should be oriented according to Article 4.5 of the Convention, which says: \\x1cParties that are developed countries will support the development and improvement of endogenous capacities and technologies of Parties that are developing countries\\x1d. The development of endogenous technological capabilities in developing countries is crucial and includes the ability to adapt and improve existing technologies. For this, it is necessary to establish provisions so that intellectual property systems do not constitute a barrier to effectively and fairly undertake adaptation and mitigation. Ongoing training in the use of new state-of-the-art technologies that allow its modernization to face the problems of climate change is also an important priority for developing countries, as well as the spread of technologies that are feasible to implement according to the characteristics and requirements own countries. A pending discussion is the issue of patent liberalization for those technologies that serve to fight global warming. The fundamental interest is the massification of these technologies, according to the potential that each country has, as was the case for HIV-AIDS drugs and the Doha Declaration in 2001 on intellectual property and health. Alternative measures and responses to climate change must be considered for countries whose economies depend on mono-export of hydrocarbons, and which cannot compromise the right to well-being of their populations and their development. The legal nature of the Paris agreement The principles must be those provided by International Law and the legal basis of the Paris agreement is undoubtedly the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, its principles and provisions. The agreement must be universal, binding, contemplate differentiation and include all the elements in a balanced way, providing the means to ensure compliance. The comparability of efforts and results should only be applicable to groups of countries in the same circumstances and therefore the issue of differentiation is fundamental between developed and developing countries. The agreement must be legally binding for all countries and must include a mechanism for monitoring and verifying compliance with objectives (adaptation, compensation for loss and damage and reduction of emissions) and goals (contribution of financing and technology transfer). Exactly one year after this session, in June 2014, a proposal was presented for the creation of a Legal Contact Group Submission with the aim of fulfilling Durban\\'s mandate on \\x1ca protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome under the Convention applicable to all Parties \\x1dto support the work of ADP and provide advice on the negotiating process in this context. However, to date, no proposal has been made to allow the Parties to assess the implications of the different legal forms. It is important to consider this proposal to create a legal contact group open to all parties and made up of experts in their legal field, just six months after the call in Paris. Specifying the vision of what the Paris meeting represents 2015 is not the end but the starting point of a process that must continue to meet the goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 agreement must provide for a review clause and the possibility of setting new goals for the future, so that the process is not interrupted and a situation of legal vacuum occurs. It is necessary to learn from past lessons, with the approval of the subsequent periods of the Kyoto Protocol being a benchmark when completing the first commitment period in 2012. The future agreement must be sustainable over time and therefore implementation requires be associated with the means of financing. The legal framework of the text that will guarantee any commitment to the INDC is essential so that the countries can present and have the certainty of where this contribution will be inserted. Without certainty of this context, they should only be mandatory for Annex I countries. The Paris agreement could be an annex adopted by a decision of the Conference of the Parties, and after the COP-21 in Paris a Plan de Work and foresee the term for deposit instruments between the period 2016-2020, as well as the possibility of registering INDCs. This new instrument should enter into force in 2020. New challenges in negotiation and their implications Among the proposals that have been configured as alternatives in the negotiation there are very important aspects, which must be discussed in depth due to their implications.

              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, The Maldives has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 island and low-lying coastal nations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for your diligent work and assure you of our support as we move into these critical discussions in the final months before Paris. Since we last met in Geneva, Cyclone Pam and Typhoon Maysak left a trail of destruction in our member states of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and FSM killing dozens, upending businesses and agriculture and destroying 90 percent of the housing stock in some of the affected communities. These extreme weather events are happening in the context of an average global temperature increase of less than 1 degree C, reminding us that without bold and very urgent action, far worse is yet to come and all countries will be affected. The findings from the recent technical report from the Structured Expert Dialogue of the 2013-2015 Review should give us all very serious cause for concern: 2 degrees of warming is associated with very high risks that are incompatible with the objectives of the Convention. That said, the report confirms that limiting warming to well below 1.5 degrees C is still feasible, but requires early peaking and sharp reductions in global emissions. The science of the IPCC WG3 and 2014 UNEP Gap Report further shows that zero global GHG emissions would be needed by 2060-2080. To that end, the view of the most vulnerable countries, and the majority of Parties to the Convention is the right one - a 1.5 degree limit must be a part of the Paris agreement for the sake of present and future generations. Co-Chairs, Under all projected scenarios, avoiding the worst impacts of climate change require us to rapidly scale up and implement solutions in the near term. We believe Workstream 2 under the ADP, which focuses on pre-2020 ambition, has already produced a useful set of good practices and policy options for ramping up ambition. We look forward to advancing this work during the follow up Technical Expert Meetings on renewable energy and energy efficiency at this session. Co-Chairs, In terms of the Paris agreement, we have our work cut out for us here if we hope to stay on track for the looming deadline. Progress has been made, with a number of Parties coming forward with their iNDCs and pledges for the Green Climate Fund. AOSIS members are committed to tabling our iNDCs as soon as possible. But the truth is that the emissions reductions required to guarantee the survival of the members of AOSIS don??t yet add up, and we still find ourselves a long way short of the goal of $100 billion a year by 2020 in climate finance agreed in in Cancun. AOSIS is of the view that the 2015 agreement must be an ambitious, legally binding Protocol capable of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees. It needs to be designed to increase ambition through consecutive commitments toward achieving our long-term goal, and it must fill gaps in current climate finance architecture and flows, including the significant increased of support for adaptation projects in most-vulnerable countries and promote enhanced mitigation efforts. The barriers to access for capacity-constrained countries must also be addressed. Co-Chairs, Finally, with the effects of climate change already taking a toll, and other slowonset impacts such as oce\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honor to speak on behalf of Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-?Chairs At the outset we wish to express our appreciation for the way the ADP co?\\x10chairs have conducted the discussions since your appointment and reiterate our support to you in the extremely important task of guiding Parties towards consensus. We believe that the Geneva session has been an important milestone in the negotiation process of the 2015 agreement. It produced the Geneva Text, which provides us an appropriate basis for negotiations, as it reflects all Parties` views and inputs. We express our strong desire to make further progress during this session, by making balanced progress among the six mandated elements of the 2015 agreement under the Durban Platform, i.e., mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-?\\x10building and transparency of action and support, as well as giving proper and adequate consideration to workstream 2. The BASIC countries believe that achieving consensus requires the strengthening of the multilateral rules?\\x10based regime under the Convention, in full accordance with its principles, and provisions. The Paris agreement should enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, not create a new regime or restructure, reinterpret or rewrite the Convention. Co\\x10Chairs We have before us the complex task of streamlining and reducing the draft negotiating text, in a matter that is open, fully transparent, inclusive and Party-?\\x10driven, with a view to building consensus. With that in mind we support your proposed way forward. It is the view of the group that we must advance on all the six elements mandated in Durban, in a balanced manner and coherent structure. Coherence is also fundamental to address cross-?\\x10cutting issues in all sections of the negotiating text, in particular differentiation between developed and developing countries and the application of the principles of equity and CBDR &RC. In this regard, the group underscores the need for the provisions of the agreement to fully reflect different responsibilities and development stages of developed and developing countries. BASIC countries would like to underline our view that the so-?called \\x1cself differentiation\\x1d approach is not consistent with the principles and provisions of the Convention, nor with the Durban mandate or the Lima Call for Climate Action. While Parties may nationally determine their own contributions in the context of the current Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) process, they can not unilaterally determine or rewrite their commitments or obligations under the legal framework of the Convention. BASIC countries also do not support efforts by some Parties to take key issues, such as climate finance, outside the scope of the Convention in an effort to bypass its unique legal character. The 2015 agreement is a vehicle to enhance the implementation of commitments in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention. This requires honoring and implementing existing commitments and responsibilities by developed countries. Enhanced action will not be achieved by shifting these burdens to developing countries, who have already taken on the largest and disproportionate share of the burden on a voluntary basis and often without support -?\\x10 even though they are not the ones with primary responsibility for causing climate change. It is also important to take into account that adaptation needs are driven by the extent of adverse effects of climate change experienced and the challenges faced by developing countries both and in the future and hence adaptation is an issue which requires a global response, in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. BASIC countries are intensifying domestic preparations for our intended nationally determined contributions towards the objective of the Convention, as decided in the UN Warsaw and Lima Climate Conferences. We would like to indicate that the results of our current ambitious national initiatives will be duly reflected in our respective contributions, as appropriate. Co?\\x10Chairs, The group would like to express its views regarding the time allocated to and scope of workstream 2. Although, the TEMs have been helpful it is important to note that workstream 2 is not limited to TEMs only. It should also cover pre2020 ambition not only focusing on mitigation but adaptation and means of implementation for developing countries. As such, more time should be dedicated to discuss other aspects of workstream 2 issues and ways to ensure that enhanced actions are agreed to in a draft decision text on pre 2020 ambitions. Regarding the pre-???2020 ambition, we reiterate that the Kyoto Protocol remains the essential and legally binding basis for addressing pre-???2020 mitigation ambition and call for the expeditious ratification of the second commitment period. We note with concern that the pre-??2020\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, I am pleased to take the floor on behalf of CARICOM, an alliance of 14 Caribbean countries, already suffering severely from the impacts of climate change. I would like to bring to your attention the CARICOM Declaration for Climate Action, in May of this year, in advance of the Franco-Caribbean Summit on Climate Change, held in Martinique on 9 May, 2015. In this declaration, the Heads of States and Governments of CARICOM countries recognised that extreme weather and slow onset events and their adverse impacts including sealevel rise, coastal erosion, coral bleaching, flooding, ocean acidification, and sea temperature rise, related to climate change, are fundamental threats to the sustainable development of Caribbean countries and island territories. Our leaders further noted that, already, with global warming of less than a degree, Caribbean countries are experiencing more frequent and intense storms, droughts, extreme weather events, accelerating sea-level rise and other life-threatening impacts. They emphasised that the global goal of limiting average temperature increase to below 2?C levels is inadequate for protecting fragile ecosystems in SIDS as some ecosystems in the Caribbean are already approaching the limits of their adaptive capacities. Consequently, there is an urgent need to close the gap between the current mitigation commitments of Parties and the level of effort required to hold the increase in global average temperature to below 1.50C above pre-industrial levels. Our leaders also expressed concern over the inadequacy of the financial resources made available by the international community to support the actions required to reduce the impacts of climate change in the Caribbean and recognised the role of forests in mitigating climate change, and the importance of anchoring the Warsaw REDD Plus Framework in the 2015 Agreement. Co-chairs, The ADP negotiations, which culminate in Paris, France, in December 2015, will be critical to closing the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap and to securing a new universal agreement that focuses the efforts of all Parties towards stronger climate action. Caribbean countries have exhibited leadership, including through agreement on a common framework to support the transformation of their energy systems. We are adopting ambitious national strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, Caribbean countries, together with other SIDS, have continued to emphasize the need for ambitious and urgent action to address climate change, and further, that SIDS, as lowlying and small island countries, remain a special case, considering our unique and particular vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. This is recognised in the Convention and has been acknowledged by the international community in multiple international fora since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. Co-Chairs, This June Session is critical for moving us toward a successful outcome in Paris. We agree that we should develop from this session a streamlined version of the Geneva text which will place us in a position to make the best use of our time up until Paris. In order to do this, it is critical that, even while the process remains party-driven, you are empowered to present Parties with options which can form the basis for negotiations and substantive discussions. At this stage, there is a heightened need to move the process forward with urgency if we are to have a chance of concluding an ambitious agreement in December, 2015. Micro-management of the process by Parties should therefore be avoided. Co Chairs, We wish to draw to your attention the report of the Structured Expert Dialogue on the 2013-2015 Review of the long term global temperture goal. This report underscores the position long held by CARICOM, AOSIS, and other vulnerable countries, that the agreed goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius is inadequate and will result in severe and unacceptable consequences for threatened ecosystems and socio-economic stability in vulnerable countries, in particular for small island developing and low-lying coastal States. It is clear that this Report, the result of a two-year rigourous examination of the relevant findings of the 5th Assessment Report of the IPCC, as well as other reliable inputs, must be considered as a critical contribution to the ongoing discussions in the ADP, in particular as it relates to a decision on the long term global mitigation goal. The report is a firm basis for Parties to take a decision to enhance the existing 2 degrees goal to 1.5 degrees consistent with meeting the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. The summary of the findings of the Structured Expert Dialogue on the 2013-2015 Review are also relevant for our treatment of the issue of loss and damage. The SED has found that significant climate impacts are already occurring at the current level of warming, and that substantial adverse and irreversible impacts of climate change will remain under all levels of warming, even with adaptation.

Mr. Co-chair, we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-chair our Coalition is well prepared and determined to move the process forward and immediately begin work. In particular, we reiterate that the solution to the climate change problem cannot ignore the vital role that rainforests play in both the mitigation and the adaptation to climate change. Current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not stabilize temperatures under the 1.5C scenario unless the contribution of rainforests is fully taken into account. Therefore, the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ must be anchored broadly in all relevant sections of the 2015 agreement. REDD+ can offer a practicable and costeffective solution to close the mitigation ambition gap. Reductions of GHG emissions through REDD+ must be implemented on the basis of the most recently agreed IPCC estimation methodologies. Mr. Co-chair, adequate, predictable and sustainable financial and technology support for the implementation of the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ must continue to be\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Before I make our statement, I would like to express the Group\\x19s condolences to the people of Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh for the devastation and tragic loss of life they suffered recently subsequent to the earthquake of 25 April. This and other disasters, many of which are climate related, are sobering reminders to us all of the vulnerability of mankind to natural disasters. Co-Chairs My Group wishes to express its full support to the Co-Chairs as they guide us to a successful outcome to these negotiations. We also thank the Co-Chairs for their scenario note and recognise the secretariat\\x19s work in identifying overlaps and duplications in the Geneva text. We also hope that we can find the time and space during this session in Bonn to address important cross-cutting issues, such as structure, legal form and differentiation, which we believe will catalyse progress in the negotiations. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of openness, inclusiveness and transparency in this process. Co-Chairs Climate change is already having serious impacts in developing countries. Despite the fact that we have not chosen this reality, developing countries are committed to address the challenge of climate change. In fact, we have proved that we already do more than what was already envisaged by the Convention. For many years we have been taking ambitious action on all fronts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, without adequate and predictable means of implementation. Indicative of developing countries\\x19 commitment is the hard work currently underway to prepare INDCs in order to submit these well in advance of Paris. Developing countries are embarking on the INDC process, despite the fact that developed countries are not putting forward intended commitments with respect to the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building. In this regard, the commitment of developing countries to address climate change is of great significance, particularly since developed countries have not honoured their existing obligations under the Convention: neither as far as the actions required from them, nor as far as the provision of the necessary means of implementation to developing countries. Also indicative of developing countries\\x19 commitment to this process is the fact that the Doha Amendment has so far been accepted by 29 developing countries and only 3 developed countries. Recognition by developed countries of the contributions already made by developing countries is critically important and can help to unlock difficult issues in the negotiations. It is in this context that the G77 and China are here in Bonn to call on developed countries to demonstrate their commitment to addressing climate change by agreeing to the following: Honouring existing commitments under the Convention and Kyoto Protocol  Developed countries need to honour their existing commitments. This means respecting the principles and provisions of the Convention, including the principle of CBDR&RC and equity, which have been reaffirmed in Lima, as well as advancing important implementation issues under the subsidiary bodies. ADP: pre-2020 ambition With regard to the work of the ADP in particular, the Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre-2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP that has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. Workstream II is essentially about accelerating the implementation of existing commitments and ways to promote enhanced ambition and will be critical for an agreement in Paris. This includes honouring their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, including the acceptance of the Doha Amendment, as well as substantially increasing their ambition for the second commitment period and their Copenhagen/Cancun pledges. It also includes developed countries?? commitment to mobilise US$100 billion in climate finance by 2020, a clear pathway to achieve this and pledges made to the Green Climate Fund. Post-2020 Regime With regard to the Paris agreement, the G77 and China call for a comprehensive and equitable outcome dealing with all the agreed element, inter alia mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support in a balanced manner. To achieve this, we need the commitment of our partners to work towards a multilaterally agreed outcome in Paris that is inclusive and rules-based, applicable to all Parties under the Con\"',\n",
              "       '\"Mr Co-Chairs, I would like to associate my statement to the statements made by South Africa on behalf of the group of 77 and China, Sudan on behalf of the Africa Group, the Maldives on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). Mr Co-Chairs, Let us also renew our deep solidarity to our colleagues and to all the people of Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh for the dramatic events that hit all these countries in the past recent weeks and months. The events in Nepal should remind us not only how vulnerable, any country could be in the face of extreme events, but how much greater is the vulnerability of those that are the least developed among us. Mr Co-Chairs, may you also accept our appreciation for your diligent efforts in leading the work of the ADP since the beginning of this year. Even, if the achievement so far is highly estimable, the tasks at hand remain paramount. We commend your efforts to reach before the beginning of this session an agreed modus operandi on the way Parties are going to conduct the process. The LDC group would like to continue to give you its support and agree with your proposal to start substantive negotiations immediately after a short opening plenary. However, we would like to highlight few points of the utmost importance. 2 The LDC believe there is a need for careful balance between the progress needed to achieve an Agreement in Paris and the treatment of the process that will be driving this ahead. Here, your role as the Co-Chairs and the role of the current and incoming COP presidents are really fundamental. We would like to thank the secretariat for the tool provided on areas of overlaps and duplication. We will continue to use it, to guide us navigating throughout the negotiation text, identifying where our common views are and outlining more clearly where the real divergences are. Certainly, they will appear to us at least less numerous than they seem to be throughout the current text. Mr Co-Chairs, as we all know, the final report of the 2013-?\\x102015 Review has arrived at the conclusion that \\x1cthe \\x18guardrail\\x19 concept, in which up to 2?C of warming is considered safe, is not adequate\\x1d. The report clearly states that less warming would be preferable. What this means is clear: Warming needs to be kept to below 1.5?C degrees. The Structured Expert Dialogue thus directly lends stringent, scientific support to our position on a 1.5?C as a scientifically defensible global goal. It is critical that these strong conclusions and insights be translated into decisions and fostered actions: all Parties to urgently raise ambition, to commit toward an ambitious outcome in Paris under the ADP, outcome that address adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology, capacity building, loss and damage and transparency at the scale required by the challenge at hand. On work stream 2, our expectations in Paris are not limited to a renewed work program on enhancing mitigation ambition in the pre 2020 period and the continuation of the technical examination meetings and processes. We are looking forward the adoption and the launching of initiatives that will effectively result in enhancing mitigation by 2020 with the view to close the mitigation gap. During this session, opportunity should be given to Parties to indicate what further actions and initiatives they will be willing to launched and supported from 2015, with the view to enhance mitigation ambition and close the gap by\"',\n",
              "       '\"The Islamic Repubic of Iran has the honour of delivering this opening statement on behalf of the LikeMinded Developing Countries (LMDC) in the climate change negotiations. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, we are now close to what we hope is the end of the journey in the ADP that we started in Durban almost four years ago. We look forward to an agreed outcome in Paris that addresses all the six core elements from the Durban mandate in a balanced manner, reflects the equitable principles of the Convention particularly the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and will result in enhanced action in the context of sustainable development in implementing the UNFCCC both before and after 2020. We have continually stressed that this outcome must be achieved through an open, transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensus-building process, marked by direct negotiations among the Parties on the basis of texts that they have produced themselves. These are the benchmarks by which we will assess both the success and the legitimacy of the outcome in Paris. Co-Chairs, as developing countries, despite the multiple challenges that we continue to face in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication, the countries of the LMDC have undertaken ambitious domestic actions on climate change including on mitigation and adaptation, and in surmounting the losses and damages arising from climate change-related natural disasters, while pursuing various sustainable development pathways and eradicating poverty. We can do more of these climate actions now, up to and beyond 2020 with increased levels of international cooperation from our developed country partners through increasing ambition and action on their part to drastically reduce their emissions and to provide additional, adequate and predictable levels of finance, development and transfer of technology and know-how, and capacity-building support to developing countries. We call on developed countries to do more to honor and fulfill their obligations under the Convention \\x13 to be more ambitious on mitigation than is shown in what they have put forward in their Cancun pledges and Kyoto Protocol commitments up to 2020 and in their INDCs for post 2020, and to provide and substantially enhance financial, technology and know-how development and transfer, and capacity building support for developing countries to adequate and predictable levels in support of developing countries\\' climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. Co-Chairs, we have proactively and constructively put forward textual proposals that reflect the best way through which the Convention\\x19s implementation will be fully, effectively and sustainably enhanced before and after 2020, in which the Convention\\x19s principles, provisions, and structure are fully respected and reflected in a way that is in full accordance with the differentiated obligations and commitments of developed and developing countries, and is consistent with Article 4 of the Convention. Increasing ambition includes holistically reflecting the inegrated treatment of mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to 2 developing country Parties. The Paris outcome must also incorporate a meaningful approach to address the adverse impacts of response measures. We reiterate that what we will achieve in Paris must be under the Convention, guided by the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention. The result must be to enhance the implementation of the Convention in order to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2, and not to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or replace the Convention or reinterpret its principles and provisions. The concepts or approaches such as \\x1cevolving CBDR\\x1d or \\x1cParties in a position to do so\\x1d are not consistent with the principles of the Convention and are not acceptable. Concepts such as these and issues that did not obtain consensus among the Parties through the COP in Lima such as an ex ante review (whether or not in the guise of an INDC workshop) may not be made part of the work of the ADP in the run-up to Paris as they only make it more difficult to achieve trust and build confidence in this process. We stress that Parties\\' INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 must be consistent with the Parties\\x19 respective obligations and commitments under Article 4 of the Convention. In this context, we expect developed country Parties to communicate well in advance of Paris their INDCs not only on post-2020 emission reduction targets but also on post-2020 targets, policies and measures for the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to developing countries. We stress that the INDCs by developing country Parties on post-2020 enhanced action, including as appropriate, mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage are to be prepared, communicated and implemented in the context of achieving sustainable development and the implementation of Article 4.7 of the Convention. Pre-2020 ambition should be primarily achieved through the implementation of the outcomes of the Bali Roadmap. Therefore, accelerating the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw COP decision 1/CP.19 and paragraph 17 and 18 of the Lima Call for Climate Action (decision 1/CP.20) must be the priority of the pre-2020 outcomes in Paris. The workplan on pre-2020 ambition should deal with the accelerated implementation process and technical examination proce\"',\n",

Like others, Umbrella Group countries wish to get straight to work to deliver an ambitious, effective and globally applicable legal climate change agreement by Paris. We thank you for your detailed scenario note. We continue to see our main objective under workstream 1 as delivering a concise, durable and operational legal agreement. As a step toward this, we welcome the opportunity to work on streamlining the negotiating text and starting to consolidate options to build areas of convergence. As part of this exercise we should: Identify content that is more appropriate for decision text, as distinct from provisions that are suitable for a durable legal agreement including by considering what work can appropriately be done after Paris and where this should be done; Focus on areas of the text where there is opportunity to build better conceptual understanding, as a basis for building convergence. These could include the nature of adaptation commitments; process for finalisation and update of mitigation contributions; aggregate review; transparency and the global goal; Continue to keep in mind matters relating to the structure of the agreement. Umbrella Group countries are committed to submitting our iNDCs well in advance of Paris, as we agreed in Warsaw and Lima - many have already been submitted, and others are working hard to submit in coming weeks. We look forward to participating in the event on INDCs here in Bonn. We also look forward to Technical Experts Meetings on renewable energy supply and energy efficiency in urban environments. And we look forward to work on a workstream 2 decision for Paris, focussed on building on the important decision we took in Lima, and enhancing TEMs beyond 2015. We support the allocation of time for negotiations on a workstream 2 draft decision for Paris. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Sudan takes the floor on behalf of the African Group, and fully supports the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the G77 and China. Co-Chairs, The African Group believes that we are on the right track, even though we need to pick up speed of the negotiations. Noting that we have only 10 days of negotiating time before Paris, the notion of inter-sessional work by co-chairs to assist Parties in making the text more negotiable and concise, with clear options for Parties to negotiate is particularly useful. This inter-sessional work requires a careful balance that would allow Parties to engage in negotiations on the first day of the August session. Our vision for the process going forward, which we trust is shared by a number of Parties, is that of a step-wise progression such that no Parties are left behind. It is a vision where in August we spend most of our efforts on negotiating the text in its entirety to clearer options that are manageable; Whilst the October session would be a space where we further negotiate the various options in the context of what would be in the core agreement, and what would be in supplementary decisions to the agreement, and accompanying decisions, particularly with regards to Workstream II. Co-Chairs, On the issue of what would be in the core agreement, and what would be in supplementary decisions, in light of time available and the need to have a durable agreement, it is our view that the 2015 Agreement should reflect Articles that enhance the implementation of Article 4 provisions of the Convention. The Articles of the new agreement should have balance in legal form for all elements, particularly support to developing countries. Those aspects that pertain to international processes to implement its provisions should also be defined in the agreement, with an understanding that more work would need to be undertaken between 2016 and 2020 to bring them to effect. Co-Chairs, On Workstream II, the African Group, like other developing country sub-groups, worked diligently with the G77 and China to advance a comprehensive and ambitious elements text on pre-2020 action, containing: a section on the work programme on pre-2020 action; a section of the Accelerated implementation in the pre-2020 period; a section on both The Mitigation Technical Expert Process and a section on An adaptation Technical Expert Process; a section on Multilateral cooperation, and a section on Enhancing high-level engagement. Co-Chairs, We appreciate the work done by our co-facilitators in producing a note capturing the current status of the discussion. In the next iteration of such a note we would plea for an integration of both the submissions made by G77 and China on behalf of all developing countries as well as reflecting the very rich conversations we have had through our 4 facilitations. The African Group wishes to reiterate its support to the co-chairs, and recognise the role that co-chairs have in helping the process to arrive at a successful outcome in Paris. We would further affirm the need for the co-chairs to provide clear guidance to the facilitators so as to ensure consistency in approach, and balance across elements. We see this as an essential element in expediting our work, and improving the speed at which we comprehensively address the various sections within elements of the text. Co-Chairs, I thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co\\x10Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We arrived in Bonn with a clear objective to engage in real substantive negotiations on key issues. The conversations we had with our partners here confirmed our assessment that the prospects for a deal in Paris are good and that there is strong political will to adopt a legally binding agreement that is applicable to all Parties and compatible with the below 2?C objective. However, we consider that progress in this session has been far too slow. The immediate product from last ten days is a minor consolidation of the Geneva text and suggestions on how it could be better structured. That mechanical editorial exercise should have been done by the Secretariat before we arrived in Bonn. Now we only have 10 negotiation days before we meet in Paris, where we are tasked to adopt a legally binding agreement applicable to all Parties and the related COP decisions. In order to be able to do that, it is essential that we have a concise text that clearly brings out the main options. We are pleased that the co?Chairs have agreed to take on the task of producing such a text. We are broadly in support of what the \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The Group of 77 and China is encouraged by the progress made to advance our work under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force to be adopted in Paris later this year, as well as the work to raise pre-2020 ambition. The Group also appreciates the cooperative and constructive spirit that Parties have demonstrated during this session of the ADP. We wish to thank you and the co-facilitators for patiently guiding us through the Geneva text to streamline and consolidate options. We are confident that although our progress here in Bonn has been modest, the time spent will allow us to accelerate the pace of negotiations at the next sessions of the ADP. It remains important that we engage in our work in an open, transparent, Party-driven and consensus building manner in order to provide all Parties with the assurances needed to secure an equitable and ambitious agreement in Paris. Co-Chairs, We now need to move forward with determination and urgency. The Group wishes to stress the importance of increasing the pace at which we work in the upcoming August meeting here in Bonn. In order to avoid a protracted procedural discussion, it is crucial to have absolute clarity on the way forward, including on the work you intend to undertake as Co-Chairs in the intersessional period, as well as on what we can expect to be the basis and mode of work when we come back to Bonn. The Group feels that it is important to enter into substantive negotiations without any further delay. In this regard the Group thanks you for the proposal you have made on the way forward. We support the proposal that the Co-Chairs prepare, with the support of the secretariat and the co-facilitators, a single document based on the structure of Annex II of your scenario note dated 5 May 2015. We are reassured that all Parties\\x19 proposals remain on the table as we move forward towards Paris. We wish to make clear our understanding that we regard the documents that have been produced here in Bonn, as well as the document you have indicated that you will present to Parties after this session to have the status only of non-papers. It is important that your document address the six core elements mandated by the Durban Platform decision in a comprehensive and balanced manner both in the agreement text and decision text, without prejudice to the Parties\\x19 proposals and would not prejudge the priority, sequencing and final placement of issues. With regard to your proposal to present Parties a document indicating what in your view should go in the Paris agreement and what will need to be dealt with in decisions, the Group wishes to stress the importance of addressing all the elements in the Durban Platform in both places in a comprehensive and balanced manner, preserving the structure of the Geneva text and taking into account that there are many issues that Parties believe should be addressed in the agreement, as well as in decisions. We also believe that you should keep in mind that there are certain issues for which it may be too early to make a determination regarding their proper placement. It is therefore important that we leave here with a clear understanding that your document will be without prejudice to Parties\\x19 right at our next sessions to propose that options, paragraphs, elements, etc. be moved. We wish to call on you again to create appropriate opportunities for Parties to reflect on the cross-cutting issues, such as scope, support, thematic parity, equity, differentiation, structure and legal form, at an appropriate time. This should not be a theoretical exercise, but rather take place in the context of specific text that Parties are working on. The Group once again wishes to remind you how important it is to allow for sufficient coordination time for groups. We believe that the process will benefit greatly if Parties can have the opportunity to iron out differences on specific issues where there are several different options in the text. Co-Chairs The Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre-2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP that has a direct bearing on the successful outcome of the Paris COP. We reiterate that Workstream II shall be treated in a balanced manner with Workstream I. The Group shares its concern on unbalanced progress between Workstream I and II in this session. We recognize that we have only 10 negotiating days until Paris. The G77 and China submission to advance our work We need to go beyond a compilation and advance to a textual negotiation as soon as possible. We request the co-chairs, with the co-facilitators and Secretariat to draft an inclusive paper based on: Parties submissions, interventions and presentations of their proposals made here in Bonn Facilitators outputs; Further submissions by parties intersionally Co Chairs, This should enable us to keep all of the options on the table and consider this new paper as a starting point, a basis of our discussions at ADP 2-10. In order to allow time for further submissions, it should be issued with the scenario note for ADP 2-10. We thank you for providing us with a number of slots for our Workstream II discussions here in Bonn. The G77 and China has engaged constructively in these discussions, including through the submission of common G77 and China position paper on elements for a Workstream II decision.

              "       '\"Co-chairs, The Republic of Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. The African Group fully associates itself with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 plus China. As a group we reaffirm our confidence in your ability to facilitate an outcome that can be owned by all Parties. We further thank you for the diligent effort in the preparation of the \\x18tool\\x19 contained in your scenario note of 24 July 2015. The tool does help us Parties to work towards a basis for negotiation that Parties can own. We, however, note that a lot of work needs to be done in order to arrive at a text that our Ministers can consider in Paris. We would like to underline the importance of striving for balance in the text, Party ownership of our work, and the use of effective work methods. We have strong reservations on the text as presented in your tool, as well as the work methods proposed for this session. However, we place value in making best use of time available during this as such we would like to propose the following. Firstly, to achieve balance and provide an assurance to Parties that no ideas are off the table, it is important that we use this session to arrive at a text that can be considered by Parties as basis for negotiation, building on the co-chairs\\x19 tool. The co-chairs\\x19 proposal to address all three parts of the tool is quite important in this respect. We, however, understand that this exercise does not require a negotiation, rather an opportunity for Parties to clarify their placement considerations. This should restore the necessary balance in the text. Secondly, it is important that Parties own the process and the text, hence it is important for the co-chairs to create space for Parties to provide guidance on the work methods for this session. We note the importance of bilateral consultation of Parties and Groups of Parties with the co-chairs, however we do not see it as a substitute for solutions that emerge from engagement by Parties. In this respect, we propose that the co-chairs periodically convene head of delegation consultations, parallel to the facilitated discussions so that they can present their views on both the substance and progress in the negotiations, as well as consideration of mode of work proposed by the co-chairs, following bilateral consultations with various Groups of Parties. This is important for Parties to directly address each other\\x19s concerns. We would further propose that a similar meeting is convened in the morning of 2 September to take stock, as well as on the 4th of September, to reflect on co-chairs proposal for 4 September for the ADP 2-11. Lastly, to ensure effective work methods, it is our view that the co-chairs need to give a clear and consistent mandate to the co-facilitators so as to ensure that Parties can prepare meaningfully for the session, as well as take stock of progress across the different sections of the text. We welcome the proposed a mode of work where all Parts of the co-chairs\\x19 tool are dealt with simultaneously. Parties can also identify some areas which could be mechanically undertaken by the Secretariat under the guidance of the co-chairs, such as parts of section III and V of Part II could be merged into a single text, as they both pertain to the work necessary for the agreement to enter into force. Co-chairs, We would like to reiterate our Ministers\\x19 vision for the 2015 Agreement, where Africa envisions an agreement that, Will be under the Convention and in accordance with its principles and provisions in particular the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equity. Further enhance the implementation of the Convention and its Annexes, be consistent with science and equity, and further enhance a multilateral rules based system in a balanced and ambitious manner; Provides parity between mitigation and adaptation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries from inadequate aggregate mitigation efforts. Further, the agreement should ensure mitigation ambition keeps the world on track for global temperature increase that is well below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre- industrial levels by the end of the century; Operationalise of the global responsibility for adaptation, through a global goal for adaptation that enhances the implementation of adaptation commitments under the Convention, which recognise adaptation investments by developing countries, adaptation needs and costs including adequacy of support from developed countries. The Group reaffirms that loss and damage is very critical to the core agreement, so as the linkage between inadequate mitigation ambition with adaptation and loss and damage; Reaffirms the international obligation for all developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex II to provide climate finance to developing countries as a means to enhancing action towards achieving the objectives of the Convention. The Ministers further emphasised the importance of scaling-up financial resources for the period beyond 2020, as a deal in Paris would be impossible without clarity on this matter. Co-chairs, In relation to workstream II, we note the elements of a draft decision prepared by the workstream II co-facilitators. We believe this is a useful step in our work together but that much more work is required during this session to prepare an ambitious and comprehensive decision that fulfils the mandate under the Durban Platform. We remind Parties that our efforts under workstream II are to ??close the ambition gap with a view to ensuring the highest possible mitigation efforts by all Parties??. To close the growing gap between our collective efforts and a pathway consiste\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Co-Chairs. On behalf of AILAC we would like to make some comments on the tool that you have provided us to advance our deliberations. We would like to associate ourselves with the statement delivered by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. AILAC welcomes your effort, together with the facilitators and the Secretariat, to provide the ADP with a tool that enables us to focus our discussions on the truly critical aspects that define the Paris package and deliver an effective, fair and durable outcome. This package must ensure that there is progression beyond exiting commitments as a necessary condition for enhanced ambition. The elements that are reflected in the Agreement must ensure its durability and comprehensively address all issues in a balanced manner. With this in mind, the Agreement must include an ambitious objective that catalyses action towards the achievement of a long term mitigation goal. A durable, ambitious agreement implies the establishment of nationally determined mitigation commitments, as well as commitments on adaptation, means of implementation and on transparency of action and support. Durability of this arrangement and the continuous enhancement of ambition is ensured by embedding short term, successive commitment cycles for nationally determined commitments that provide the certainty and predictability that Parties will continue to update and implement commitments into the future. A short\\x10term commitment cycle is the most effective way to create an agreement that is capable of triggering countries to frequently revisit and enhance their ambition, significantly increasingly the momentum towards reaching the objective of the Convention and the 2?C goal. These commitment cycles, as well as a specific long\\x10term emissions trajectory that reflect the latest recommendations of the IPCC, a definition of a long\\x10term qualitative goal on finance and a global adaptation goal will also be critical to securing an ambitious and durable agreement. The Agreement must reflect and address the linkage between mitigation ambition and adaptation, loss and damage, and means of implementation. This is a cross cutting element and acknowledging this linkage, allows for operationalizing enhanced mitigation ambition to reduce adaptation needs and associated costs. Adaptation is an issue that goes beyond the local dimension, and has global effects. This demands adaptation action to be undertaken as a commitment on behalf of all Parties in a successive and consistent manner and the provision of means of implementation for adaptation as an instrumental part of the achievement of global resilience enhancement and vulnerability reduction. AILAC strongly urges Parties to build on what we have done so far to improve the understanding of each other??s positions, so that this session in Bonn delivers the necessary inputs for an evolved version of a negotiating text before the October sessions. This is a criti\"',\n",

Co-Chairs, At the outset, let me thank you for your diligent work since last session. We are prepared to use your negotiating \\x1ctool\\x1d to make further progress here. However, it is important for us to have more clarity on the specific modalities of work this week and the intended outcome of the session. Indeed, there is no time to waste. Just last week, NASA released findings that show the world may already be locked into one metre of sea level rise\\x14putting many small islands and low-lying coastal states at risk for severe flooding if not total inundation by the end of the century. We also saw Tropical Storm Erika\\x19s travel a deadly path through Dominica in the Caribbean and, of course, the devastation wrought by Cyclone Pam and Typhoon Maysak as they passed through Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and FSM earlier this year will not soon be forgotten. Co-Chairs, Such extreme weather events are happening in the context of an average global temperature increase of less than 1 degree C, reminding us that without bold and very urgent action, far worse is yet to come. This inescapable reality should add urgency to our work and inform the agreement that we are developing for Paris. An ambitious and effective agreement must contain the following: First, with respect to mitigation, it is critical that a pathway to achieving below the 1.5 degree global goal is reflected in the Paris agreement. The agreement must do more than institute a new process; it must also deliver outcomes and demand ambitious performance through internationally legally binding and quantified mitigation commitments that increase global ambition over successive commitment cycles. The agreement must be designed to limit global average temperature increase to well below 1.5 degrees C and the agreement\\x19s articles must operationalize the achievement of this objective Second, with respect to finance, we know that tackling climate change and adapting to its impacts will require a minimum of $100 billion USD per year by 2020. Developed countries must deliver on this commitment and further commit to scale up the provision of support beyond 2020 if we are to realise the level of ambition required to avert the worst impacts of climate change. It is also essential to maintaining trust in the process. Unfortunately we are still a long way short of this climate finance goal to which we agreed in Cancun. Third, with respect to loss and damage, we are now experiencing impacts from human- induced climate change that cannot be addressed through adaptation, such as those from accelerating sea level rise and increasing ocean acidification. To effectively manage these, an international mechanism to address loss and damage must be a central element of the Paris agreement. The Warsaw decision and the IPCC 5th Assessment Report acknowledge that loss and damage results when climate impacts exceed the limits of our adaptation measures. Loss and damage should be treated as a separate and distinct element of the agreement, and the mechanism defined under this agreement should be mandated to initiate a process to address irreversible and permanent damage. An agreement that purports to take meaningful action, while failing to address the central concerns of SIDS, equates to having no\"',\n",

Co-Chairs, We thank you for the efforts that you made during your meetings with the various groups and during informal ministerial meetings, and we thank you for the memorandum you issued during the past month, which includes the work methodology to be followed during this stage, as well as the mechanism for dealing with the Geneva text. Referring to the content of this mechanism and the method of work during this tour, the Arab Group would like to express the following: First, the proposed mechanism does not constitute a basis or reference for discussion, and we affirm the parties\\' right to review the texts and classification as consistent with their positions. Second - The mechanism, as proposed, is neither balanced nor comprehensive, nor consistent with the primary objective of the Durban Resolution. We have also indicated that the mechanism is biased towards introducing new concepts and ideas that are in the aggregate of mitigation and strong legal formulation, at the expense of adaptation and support means. Third - The outputs from informal ministerial meetings and meetings outside the technical negotiating track of the Durban curriculum should not overlap with the negotiating track and not affect the conditions surrounding the negotiations. Fourth - The performance of the meeting heads concerned with the different parts of the agreement must be evaluated and the necessity of correcting their method of work to prevent imposition Presidents\\' positions and their own agenda. Fifth- We would like to focus on the importance of transparency and inclusiveness for all parties as necessary to ensure the fairness and success of the negotiations. Honorable Presidents of the session, The Arab Group hopes for serious negotiations between the parties and avoids the imposition of presenting texts of the last minute and affirms Once again, its full support to the session presidents and its readiness for constructive and meaningful discussions to reach successful and satisfactory outcomes.

              "       '\"Co?Chairs, I have the honor to speak on behalf of Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement of the Group of 77 and China. Co?Chairs, We reaffirm that the process and outcome of ADP should be guided by and be in full accordance with all principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. The 2015 agreement shall address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate ? mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity?building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support. An ambitious outcome of the ADP should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner. In this session, we should focus on the core provisions to be included in the agreement, including all core elements of the Durban mandate. Further detailing of the provisions, including modalities and technical aspects, could be addressed in COP decisions, as agreed by Parties. We reiterate that commitments under the agreement must be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Parties\\x19contributions will be nationally determined and reflect each Party\\x19s highest possible effort, in accordance with its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Contributions should be comprehensive, addressing, mitigation, adaptation and the provision of support by developed to developing countries. We believe that ambition and effectiveness will be achieved by maintaining differentiation among developed and developing country Parties in each element of the agreement. This will enhance participation and efforts by all countries. With regard to the Workstream 2, the pre\\x102020 ambition gap shall be primarily addressed through the implementation of the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the outcome of the Bali Action Plan. We are concerned with the inadequacy of developed countries\\x19 current commitments on emission reductions and provision of financial and technological support. We underscore the need to shift the focus of the technical examination process from the mere identification of mitigation policy options to the identification or development of instruments that support effective and concrete implementatio\"',\n",

Mr. Co-chairs, at the outset we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co-Chairs, our Coalition welcomes the progress achieved in the last negotiating session here in Bonn and believes the additional tool you have produced captures the views expressed by all Parties. The document you have presented allows us to see a realistic structure of a post-2020 climate agreement. The division of the Geneva text into three parts will give Parties the chance to work in a more focused manner. It is however clear that there is much work to be done to move provisions from Part three into Parts one and two.

              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. The Environmental Integrity Group would like to express its solidarity with the people of Dominica, Haiti and neighboring countries who have been hit by Hurricane Erika. The number of such tragedies is increasing while we are negotiating ? dear colleagues, let us work together during this and the forthcoming ADP sessions and make everything we can to avoid an increase of natural disasters caused by climate change! Not the number of victims should get higher, but the ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our efforts to ensure resilience and reduce vulnerability. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear friends and colleagues. The EIG delegations have arrived here in Bonn committed to make together with all of you a significant step forward towards a comprehensive and effective outcome in Paris which includes a legally binding instrument containing the enduring elements of the 2015 Agreement, COP decisions with dynamic and technical elements, and nationally determined commitments and engagements for the period beyond 2020. Furthermore, the 2015 Agreement needs to address all relevant areas: mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency of action and support. We would like to thank the Co-Chairs for the tool they have developed based on the Geneva text and the discussions of our last session. This compilation is a useful step towards an agreement but we share the views of others that this tool is not sufficient, that it has many important gaps, inconsistencies and duplications. But: the tool gives us a good idea how the Geneva Negotiation Text could be structured into an agreement and COP decisions. Therefore, it can be very helpful for our discussions and negotiations. But it can only be useful if we use it in the proper manner: as a tool and not as a negotiation text. Rather than moving the elements from one section to another, we have to use the tool as a basis to decide what belongs into the legally binding agreement and what belongs in COP decisions. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear colleagues, time is running out. We have to speed up. We have now to engage in a positive and constructive manner. Time is short. But this does not mean that we have to add additional time. We have to use the time in an efficient and effective manner. If we work constructively, if we work in a solution oriented manner, then the remaining time is sufficient. If we do this throughout this week, then we have created the basis to develop a fully consolidated, streamlined, clear and concise negotiation text. We must be efficient in the use of the ten negotiation days that remain until COP 21. Mr. Co-Chairs, colleagues, the EIG has submitted several times its views and proposal on the substance, form and structure of the Paris outcome. This is not the moment to repeat this, but rather to move rapidly into work and most importantly into active interaction and engagement. We are looking forward to do this together with all our partners here. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. The conversations we have had with our partners in various fora since we last met in June have confirmed our assessment that the prospects for a deal in Paris are good. There is clear and strong political will to adopt a legally binding agreement that is applicable to all Parties and that is compatible with the below 2?C objective. We welcome the progress made at various recent ministerial discussions and look forward to progress at negotiator level now quickly following suit. With only 10 negotiating days before we meet in Paris, we need to use our remaining time to best effect. It is imperative for all Parties to engage in real negotiations with our partners. In that context we welcome the efforts of the co-Chairs, and the help of the co-facilitators, to produce their \\'tool\\'. While there are aspects of the tool that are significantly problematic for the EU \\x13 both in terms of substance and placement - we are broadly in support of the approach outlined in the scenario note. It is crucial to start to converge on which aspects of the Paris outcome will be in the Paris Protocol, and which will be in the equally important supporting decisions. We also fully support the assertion in the scenario note that the time for making compromises and building bridges is now. It will also be essential to identify clear options for Ministerial guidance in relation to issues where agreement cannot be reached at negotiator level. We must make progress in the coming days on substance: Firstly on how the 2015 Agreement will deliver transparency and accountability of Parties\\' against their mitigation commitments. Secondly, on how to ensure dynamism in the 2015 Agreement, across all elements. For mitigation this means how to secure a process to regularly revisit and, if necessary, raise ambition over time to collectively achieve an agreed long term goal. Thirdly, on how to ensure that the 2015 Agreement contributes to achieving climate resilient sustainable development and reduction of vulnerability through effective adaptation. Fourthly, on how the post 2020 regime will provide support to those countries in need. In relation to raising mitigation ambition before 2020, we welcome the draft decision and that the co-Chairs have allocated time to address this important issue. We look forward in particular to strengthening high level political engagement on this issue in the coming years and appreciate the already expressed high-level support for the Lima-Paris Action Agenda. Finally we commend those Parties that have come forward with their INDCs since we last met. We urge others to follow and come forward with ambitious and clear INDCs, in particular, all major economies. All INDCs must be implemented through robust policies to prevent dangerous climate change which is the ultimate objective of the Convention. We also note the large variety of the INDCs already presented. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs Thank you for giving me the floor. I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The Group also wishes to thank you for preparing the Non-Paper as a tool to guide our work during this session. Firstly, Co-Chairs, the Group believes that we need to accelerate the pace of our work if we are to successfully fulfil our mandate from Durban by the end of this year. However, in order to make progress, we need more clarity on the process at this session and the desired outcome. In this regard, the Group is of the view that we need a negotiating text from this session to be the basis of further work. To achieve this, the process we follow must prioritise balance, party ownership and effective working methods. Although the clustering of issues is helpful in focusing our attention to the key issues that will need to be resolved, the Group is of the view that the manner in which many issues have been placed has resulted in the document being unbalanced. Many issues such as principle of CBDR, linkage between action by developing country Parties and support by developed country Parties, institutions on adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, loss and damage, response measures and scope of contributions, which are important to the Group are now found in Part III, creating the impression that there is doubt about whether they need to be included in the agreement, or that they may be too controversial or difficult to be agreed on in Paris at all. The Paris outcome must not be mitigation-centric and must address all the elements mandated by the Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures in a balanced manner. To make progress here in Bonn, it is very important that we gain clarity on the mandate and working methods of the facilitators, which must be consistent across the different sections. Parties should also seek to exchange views with each other, not just with the Co- Chairs and facilitators, as this process is and should remain a Party-driven process. In order to ensure that the engagement between Parties is constructive, the Group needs to be given sufficient time and opportunity to coordinate its positions. At the previous session evening coordination was turned into negotiation time, which has hampered the ability of our Group to work on consolidating our proposals. Therefore when the Group requests additional coordination time, we trust that it will be understood. Co-Chairs The G77 also firmly believes that progress on pre-2020 ambition is crucial for the success of Paris and will lay a solid foundation for the implementation and ambition of post-2020 enhanced action. Not only do we need to have sufficient time-slots to work on the elements for a draft decision on Workstream II, but the sessions devoted to this work should not take place in parallel with Workstream I sessions where the relevant experts are involved. The Group of 77 and China regards Workstream II on pre-2020 ambition as an integral part of the ADP mandate that has direct bearing on the successful adoption of the 2015 agreement. Workstream II is essentially about accelerating the implementation of existing commitments and obligations and ways to promote enhanced ambition. Progress in Workstream II will be critical for an agreement in Paris. We look forward to engaging constructively and proactively and making significant progress on the Workstream II decision at this session. Finally, we would like to thank all the contributing Parties that have provided resources for this meeting and appeal for additional resources to be allocated for future meetings, in a way that supports the adequate representation of delegates from developing countries. At this meeting many delegations are handicapped due to their being underrepresented. All efforts must be made to leave no-one behind. Finally, the Group wishes to make it clear that the UNFCCC process is the only forum where the negotiations on the Paris outcome can take place. Thank you. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Malaysia has the honour of delivering this opening statement on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) in the climate change negotiations. We fully associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We express our deep condolences to the people of Dominica who are currently facing devastating floods. Co-Chairs, we started our journey in the ADP in Durban almost four years ago and are now three months away from when we must adopt an outcome in Paris. This agreed outcome must all the six core elements from the Durban mandate in a balanced manner both in the agreement and the COP decision and reflect the principles and provisions of the Convention particularly the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Such outcome must result in enhanced action in the context of sustainable development in implementing the UNFCCC both before and after 2020. Our process at this session and all the way up to Paris must be open, transparent, inclusive, Party-driven and consensus- building, marked by direct negotiations among the Parties on the basis of texts that they have produced themselves. Only through this process will the Paris conference have a successful and legitimate outcome. In this regards, we appreciate your efforts to prepare the tool for this session but share our concern on the tool in terms of the unbalanced treatment among different elements of the Geneva text. Co-Chairs, while we face multiple challenges in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication, the countries of the LMDC have undertaken ambitious domestic actions on climate change including on mitigation and adaptation, and in surmounting the losses and damages arising from climate change-related natural disasters, while pursuing various sustainable development pathways and eradicating poverty. However, as has been most recently seen just a few days ago when Tropical Storm Erika hit Dominica, a single climate-related disaster can set back our development progress by years or decades. Nevertheless, we will and can do more of these climate actions now, up to and beyond 2020, but doing so will need increased levels of international cooperation from our developed country partners through increasing ambition on their commitments to drastically reduce their emissions and to provide additional, adequate and predictable levels of finance, development and transfer of technology and know-how, and capacity-building support to developing countries. We call on developed countries to do more to honor and fulfill their obligations under the Convention ? to be more ambitious on mitigation and to provide and substantially enhance financial support, technology and know-how development and transfer, and capacity building support for developing countries to adequate and predictable levels in support of developing countries\\' climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. Co-Chairs, we have proactively and constructively put forward textual proposals that reflect the best way through which the Convention\\x19s implementation will be fully, effectively and sustainably enhanced before and after 2020, in which the Convention\\x19s principles, provisions, and structure are fully respected and reflected in a way that is in full accordance with the differentiated obligations and commitments of developed and developing countries, and is consistent with Article 4 of the Convention. Increasing ambition includes holistically reflecting the integrated treatment of mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to developing country Parties. The Paris outcome must also incorporate a meaningful approach to address the adverse impacts of response measures. Whether the Paris outcome is ambitious and could be implemented in a sustained manner depends on whether it is consistent with the principles, provisions and structure of the Convention. The key convergence among Parties is that the Paris outcome must be under the Convention and should enhance action on the implementation of the Convention in order to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. It is not to renegotiate, rewrite, restructure or replace the Convention or reinterpret its principles and provisions. The concepts or approaches such as \\x1cevolving CBDR\\x1d, \\x1cParties in a position to do so\\x1d, \\x1csingle transparency system\\x1d or \\x1cmitigation-centric cycle\\x1d are not consistent with the principles of the Convention and are not acceptable. Therefore these concepts must be removed from the text. Co-Chairs, we stress that Parties\\' INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 must be consistent with the Parties\\x19 respective obligations and commitments under Article 4 of the Convention. In this context, we are extremely disappointed that the INDCs that have so far been communicated by developed country Parties are mitigation-centered only on post-2020 emission reduction targets and do not contain any post-2020 commitments, policies and measures for the provision of finance, technology development and transfer and capacity building support to developing countries. We stress that the INDCs by developing country Parties on post-2020 enhanced action, including as appropriate, mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage are to be prepared, communicated and implemented in the context of achieving sustainable development and the implementation of Article 4.7 of the Convention. Co-Chairs, pre-2020 ambition should be primarily achieved through the implementation of the outcomes of the Bali Roadmap. Therefore, accelerating the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Warsaw COP decision 1/CP.19 and paragraph 17 and 18 of the Lima Call for Climate Action (decision 1/CP.20) must be the priority of the pre-2020 outcomes in Paris. The workplan on pre-2020 ambition should deal with the accelerated implementation process and technical examination process in a \"',\n",

The SICA countries wish to express their support for the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We also wish to express our deep solidarity with the people and government of Dominica in this hour of pain as a result of impacts associated with climate change. Ladies and gentlemen, we have agreed to negotiate a new protocol, agreement or legal instrument within the Convention and under the Convention. Therefore, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities according to their respective capacities (CBDR-RC) and all other principles and provisions of the Convention must be expressly and unequivocally recognized as the basis of this new instrument or agreement at all stages. of the negotiation process, in accordance with the provisions of the Lima decision, 1/CP.20. It is important to highlight that this Convention prides itself on basing its actions on science. Various and well-known scientific investigations published in the course of last July and this August present concurrent evidence that the levels and rates of temperature increases, melting of polar ice and increases in sea level are occurring much earlier than anticipated, with catastrophic effects for food security, water availability, biodiversity and the very survival of communities, particularly the coastal ones, and indigenous peoples around the planet. This being the case, it is important for the SICA countries, currently impacted by a severe drought, that within these negotiations the increase in temperature of 2?C above the existing average in the era is not maintained as an immovable goal within the new protocol. pre industrial. The presidents and heads of state of the SICA countries agreed that a maximum increase of 1.5?C in temperature is more consistent with the findings of science and the already observed effects of climate change, when we have not yet reached 1 degree increase. The SICA countries consider that an increase in emissions reduction ambitions is necessary to achieve this goal, especially in developed countries. Likewise, the initiative of Conservation of tropical forests and REDD + can contribute substantively. Ladies and Gentlemen Co-presidents, given the aforementioned effects of climate change already observed, as well as the trends to acceleration and intensification in which the aforementioned scientific research converges, make it imperative that the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, strengthened and endowed of the appropriate financial resources, be an integral part of the legally binding instrument, protocol or agreement designed to respond to the realities already present and the immediate future that climate change presents. The impacts of climate change will be felt much more intensely on countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, such as those on the African continent, small island states, least developed countries, those located in interoceanic strips such as those of SICA, among others. These and other adverse effects will have severe impacts on economic growth and increases in poverty, seriously compromising their possibilities and their right to development. Therefore, tendencies to restrict climate finance only to those in greater poverty represent an inappropriate approach, which could have serious and costly repercussions in relatively short periods. Compromising or even limiting the capacity to fulfill the commitments that these countries may adopt in the framework of INDCs. Ladies and gentlemen co-chairs, we must recognize that we are still a long way from achieving the level of ambition necessary to achieve the objective of the Convention in all the required areas: mitigation, adaptation, financing, development and transfer of technology and capacity building. And we are far from the majority of countries in the world having conditions to increase the scale of compliance and implementation of the commitments that are expected to be assumed within the new agreement or protocol. If we do not take advantage of the pre-2020 period as an opportunity to accelerate implementation, to close the growing mitigation gap and create the conditions that allow all the countries of the world to have the appropriate capacities, resources and experiences, to fulfill those commitments from 2021, the new protocol will have serious limitations. This is why it is vitally important for a robust and balanced agreement in Paris that developed countries show the leadership that is required and expected of them within the Convention in the line of work or ??workstream 2??. Finally, in order for the new legal instrument, protocol or agreement with legal force to have the structure that allows it to be effectively and appropriately balanced in fulfilling the objective of the Convention, it must integrate with parity of political and legal importance all the elements recorded in the decision. 1/CP.17, from the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action: Mitigation, Adaptation, Financing, Technology Development and Transfer, Capacity Building and Transparency in Action and Support.

              "       '\"Dear Co?Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its 28 Member States. We arrived in Bonn with a clear objective to engage in substantive negotiations on key Issues. The conversations we had with our partners here confirmed our assessment that the prospects for a deal in Paris are still good and that there is strong political will to adopt a legally binding agreement that is applicable to all Parties and compatible with the below 2 degrees Celsius objective. However, while some of the spinoffs have seen Parties really engaging in the substance of the issues and while we had very constructive discussions here, our pace is still too slow to arrive at the substantial, ambitious agreement we all want, that is accompanied by clear decisions and a work programme for the years up to 2020. We need to accelerate the speed of negotiations and to that end we need a new, real basis for our deliberations. To create this basis, we think the co?chairs have all the material they need. They can capture progress achieved here, based on the views of Parties expressed, the working documents and outputs from the facilitated groups and spin offs, and produce a concise, coherent and consistent negotiating text which covers the agreement as well as substantial supporting decisions. To use the few negotiation days left before Paris well, we need this text to reflect areas of common ground, based on proposals that genuinely bridge areas of substance that have divided parties in the past, and be available as soon as possible ahead of the October session. The text needs to contain clear political options to be resolved at ministerial and higher level, and many Ministers have already provided political guidance as well as urged us to accelerate the negotiations. We would like the co?chairs to be courageous and produce, together with the help of the secretariat, and the co?facilitators, such a text as soon as possible. Clearly all Parties in this room have expressed the need for you, dear co?chairs, to produce that text so that we can begin serious negotiations the moment we arrive again in Bonn. We welcome the progress in discussions on how to raise mitigation ambition before 2020, where we feel that a substantial decision can be achieved in Paris. We were pleased to attend the INDC session and hear more information about how Parties elaborate and address their INDCs, as well as following the preview on the synthesis report that the secretariat gave today. We look forward to the full synthesis report to be presented, and the lessons it will doubtlessly contain to improve the text of the Paris agreement. We welcome that since we have been here in Bonn, more Parties have come forward with INDCs. We urge others to follow and come forward, in particular, those major economies that have not yet presented their INDCs. In summary, we feel that clarity on concepts and options, including ideas of how to bridge positions, has been achieved at this session and that this needs to be captured by what the co?Chairs produce next. We would like to thank the co?Chairs for their leadership and guidance and the co?facilitators, the spin off group leads and the Secretariat for their hard work. We wish our friends and colleagues a safe journey home and look forward to working together again in October, and succeeding together, by Paris, to produce an agreement to preserve our children and their children, from climate change and its devastating consequences, while harvesting the many co?benefits for our development and economies that climate action entails. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honour to make these remarks on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. At the outset, I wish to assure you that the Group is committed to make progress in our negotiations under the ADP. We have expressed in our stocktaking meeting on Wednesday the concern of the Group with the pace of the progress and the need for an urgent step-change in our process. As a Group, we have engaged constructively with our partners here in Bonn. However, we need to take on board the lessons we have learned at this session. There has been fragmentation of the process with the proliferation of spin-off groups. This, along with lack of clear instructions to the facilitators, which led to inconsistency in approaches followed in the different groups, have often overwhelmed and disadvantaged delegations from developing countries that are small. Having said that, it is essential that the progress we have made during this session is captured. Textual proposals made by Parties, the results of the facilitation and spin- off groups, proposals for bridging text and clarification of concepts, should be captured as milestones in order to ensure Party ownership of the process. Co-Chairs Real textual negotiations must start at the October session. For this purpose, a manageable text that is negotiable is needed. In order to achieve this, the Group wishes to give clear guidance to the Co-Chairs on how to proceed. This text must be based on the Geneva text, building on the Co-Chairs Tool and the inputs made by the Parties at this session. For Workstream I, this means a text of the draft agreement with accompanying decisions. The text must be coherently structured, properly ordered and include all the elements that Parties need to see reflected in the agreement. It must also be clear, streamlined, consolidated, simplified and balanced, presenting clear and crystalised options on all elements. Many issues that need to be contained in a decision also need a hook in the agreement and a purely binary approach is not appropriate. For Workstream II, a revised text of the decision, capturing the work done at this session is required. These texts must be made available inter-sessionally as soon as possible to enable for Parties to properly prepare for negotiations in October in order to allow textual negotiations to start immediately in the October session. At the end of the October session, we need to have a text with clearly identified political options on elements of divergence and convergence in order prepare our principals properly for Paris. Co-Chairs We need an effective method of work going forward. The Group believes that this entails a greater degree of centralisation in the management of the process. In this regard, there is a need to engage on an on-going basis during the session on cross- cutting issues and interlinkages in a central place. The utilisation of facilitation groups with clear and consistent instructions to the facilitators that consider specific issues can be very helpful to capture progress. Regular meetings with the Heads of Delegations should be used to inform Parties on the overall status of the negotiations. Stocktaking meeting at appropriate moments in the process could be helpful and should not be regarded as a waste of time. The multilateral, Party-driven process must be honoured. Parties must be able to negotiate and discuss with each other directly and not through the Co-Chairs bilaterally. Finally, Co-Chairs, we wish to assure you of our continued support and trust in your leadership to manage and guide us to a successful outcome in Paris. Thank you \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, the Republic of Sudan has the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. The African Group fully associates itself with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 plus China. As a group we recognize your facilitation efforts to fulfil the Durban mandate to adopt a legal agreement, no later than 2015. We recall our mandate as adopting a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, applicable to all. Co-chairs, we recall the mandate from ADP 2-10 for you, co-chairs, to prepare a negotiating text, building from the Geneva Text and submissions by Parties made in both the ADP 2-9 and ADP 2-10. We take note of the non-paper ADP.2015.8.Informal Note, which did provide a manageable text for Parties to consider. We would, however, wish to express that the non-paper cannot serve as a basis for negotiation, as it is not balanced and does not reflect concerns of the African Group and a number of other developing countries. Co-chairs, we assessed this text on the basis of the guidance we received from the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) in their key messages from a meeting they held on the 25 September 2015. And it is our sense that all red-lines that our leaders expressed are being crossed by your proposed text. We see the text, at best, as weak attempt to a \\x18compromise text\\x19, rather than a text that could serve as a \\x18basis for negotiation\\x19. We understand a basis for negotiation as a text that reflects views and concepts from all Parties in options that can be negotiated. Co-chairs, we would like to reflect on some of the key red-lines that are crossed on the text. Firstly, this Agreement is to be concluded under the Convention, and shall be interpreted in accordance with its objectives, and principles and provisions. It is therefore concerning that there is no reference to equity, and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities is not operationalised in the text. Secondly, the proposed text does not reflect the necessary multilateral processes in respect of adequacy of mitigation, adaptation, and support to ensure consistency with the temperature goal. Thirdly, the text does not provide instructive action on mitigation; it is weaker in key respects than the Convention we agreed 20 years ago, and offers optional platitudes on adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building. Co-chairs, the African Group has always been constructive in taking our negotiations forward, as we are a block that needs a fair and effective multilateral agreement more than any other. We believe that the outcome from Paris must strengthen the rules-based multilateral system. As such, the provisions of the Convention serve as a baseline against which there is to be no backsliding. We do not believe that it is impossible to arrive at an outcome of ADP 2-11 that is balanced, fair and that reflects different views of Parties, and as such can serve a basis for negotiation. To establish such a basis, it is important for Parties to restore the balance by bracketing some of the \\x18clean text\\x19, and insert their options. It is only once all views are reflected as options in the text that we can indeed ascertain that we have a basis for negotiation. Co-chairs, the African Group is of the view that such insertions do not take us back to the Geneva Text, but rather restore balance and consistency with the Convention. The assurance we can provide is, a first point of call where Parties either bracket some of the current text or insert some words that reflect their views. The second point of call is for Parties to propose alternative paragraphs that contain options of other Parties in brackets. The last option is a complete presentation of alternatives to an Article, for example the G77 plus China presented a complete option on adaptation, finance, and loss and damage which, if re-inserted, would establish the balance. Co-chairs, we envisage a process where all such insertions can be undertaken live on screen during the first reading of the open-ended drafting committee. On completion of the insertions in each of the Articles, without negotiation, spin-off groups for such Articles can commence with their work immediately. The African Group will not engage in the spin-off groups on the basis of an unbalanced text. It is further our view that we have daily stock- taking meetings so as to have a clear view of how the negotiation is progressing in both the open-ended drafting committee and the spin-offs. It is the fulfilment of this proposal that would allow us to leave ADP 2-11 with what could be the basis for negotiation. On Workstream 2, co-chairs, we are disappointed at how the African Group and G77 and China proposal, including with regards to adaptation has been addressed in the non-paper. We recognise the additions that have been made to the text relating to the technical examination process on mitigation, and reference to the ??co-champions??. At the same time, between the last draft (prepared by the co-facilitators) and the current non-paper, we have seen removal of references in the preamble to strengthening implementation of the Convention, and the reference to the technical examination process on adaptation has been moved out of the operative text into text that is ??subject to further discussion??. The document, in this respect, has become weaker not s\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Fellow Delegates. I have the honor to submit this statement on behalf of the AILAC group of countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama?, Paraguay and Peru. Allow us to associate ourselves with the statement submitted by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Co?Chairs, We have arrived at the final lead-up to our ultimate landing milestone: CoP 21 in Paris next December. It has been a long, complex and enriching journey for us all, made up of many stages that hold true testimony to the everlasting importance of the task at hand, the success of which can only be guaranteed by a shared conviction that only through collective ambition and action shall we implement effective commitments that produce tangible results in the global fight against the threats of climate change. The legally binding agreement and decisions that come out of Paris must above all be durable and comprehensive addressing all dimensions of the global challenge that climate change poses to present and future generations, with balanced commitments for all Parties. We have called many times, together with many of our partners, for your support in arriving at a manageable instrument for negotiations, that encompasses all issues that have been discussed over the past months and years, capturing the foundations of the extensive conceptual discussions that we have had, in an effort to bring the multiple existing positions together underpinned by our call for an ambitious, durable and fair agreement. Coming to the dawn of the ADP Process here at ADP 2-11 we have been presented by you with an instrument. Bearing in mind the need to use the little remaining time we have left in the most focused and efficient manner possible, we hope for a day of concise interventions that signal the critical gaps in the text that need to be filled, and for a new text that can be the starting point of the negotiations tomorrow. Co-Chairs, Fellow delegates, AILAC stresses the need for ambition to be the underpinning principle that guides our work. A durable, ambitious agreement implies not only the establishment of nationally determined mitigation commitments, and adaptation and means of implementation efforts, but also assurance that they will be implemented. In doing so, we are renewing the way in which the multilateral system can catalyse national action, by means of defining nationally determined contributions that Parties themselves are putting forward as commitments to be carried out under a multilateral agreement. The durability of this agreement and the continuous enhancement of ambition will be ensured by embedding short term, successive commitment cycles for nationally determined commitments that provide the certainty and predictability that Parties will continue to update and implement commitments into the future, specifically every 5 years for mitigation NDCs. A short-term commitment cycle is the most effective way to create an agreement that is capable of triggering countries to frequently revisit and enhance their ambition, significantly increasingly the momentum towards staying below the 2?C temperature increase and any other long-term emissions reduction goals decided by Parties in Paris. For AILAC, it is critical that the agreement go beyond the global temperature goal agreed in Cancun and establish a quantified, long-term trajectory, as recommended by the latest science, that will help guide Parties and signal non-state actors to collectively reach net zero emissions by the end of the century, according to the national development capabilities. Basic accounting rules for mitigation NDCs must also be included in the agreement as a way to ensure the environmental integrity and effectiveness of the agreement. It has also become clear that the definition of a collective quantitative goal for scaling up the mobilization of finance is critical to enhance the ambition and durability of the Paris outcome. Specific commitments to reach $100 billion per year in mobilized climate finance by 2020 and scale it up further in the post-2020 period are critical for the effective implementation of the Agreement. Additionally, the agreement must include an effective, robust transparency system that builds on existing arrangements under the Convention and ensures frequent and robust reporting and review of information to track progress of action and support, with the support needed for developing countries to do so. AILAC countries welcome the INDCs from nearly 150 Parties that have been presented over the past few months, reflecting Parties that represent nearly 90% of GHG emissions, which lay the foundations for enhanced action in the post-2020 period. We emphasize the need for those contributions to be clear, transparent and understandable and to respect the principles of non- back sliding on existing commitments, targets and actions under the Convention. The Paris Agreement must be shaped in a manner that addresses the fundamental linkage between mitigation efforts, adaptation and loss and damage and the corresponding need for means of implementation. The Global Stocktake that shall periodically track the successive commitments on all issues must recognize the linkage so that the underpinning ambition on all fronts ensures the delivery of aggregate long-term goals that effectively tackle the causes and adverse impacts of climate change. The High Level Sessions on Mitigation, Adaptation and Climate Finance shall build on the outputs resulting from such a Stocktake process, in a manner that catalyses implementation of national action oriented towards the achievement of agreed global goals. An equitable and fair agreement must include Loss and Damage, a reality this is already affecting countries and will become more pressing if sufficient mitigation ambition is not achieved. Therefore Loss and Damage must be adequately recognized and reflected in the agreement, including various institutional arrangements necessary to fully ad\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-presidents, I have the honor to make this intervention on behalf of the members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the peoples of our America - ALBA: Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Dominica and others. The peoples of the five continents of the world, Heads of State of ALBA, Ministers, authorities, and personalities, we met in Tiquipaya-Bolivia a few days ago to listen to his message in order to preserve life against the adverse effects of climate change and in response to the failed capitalist system and an irrational civilizing model that is the structural cause of the climate crisis in the world that has broken the balance with Mother Earth and has generated an ecological debt, with a social repercussion that falls mainly on the countries in developing. The peoples of the world demand climate justice and ask to adopt a new civilizational model, building a plural world that defends the universal common goods and the rights of Mother Earth, putting science at the service of humanity, incorporating ancient knowledge and practices, allocating the resources of the military machinery of the countries that promote war to finance the actions of the peoples against the climate crisis. The peoples of the world are calling for the impunity of developed countries to end and they urgently demand that they fulfill their commitments. For the climate agreement to be legitimate, it must be based on a holistic vision that reflects the concerns of the peoples and their subsistence in the face of the threats posed by the adverse effects of climate change. The responsibility of the States for the legitimate concerns of the peoples cannot be ignored by trying to transfer it to the private sector and, in particular, to the interests of transnational corporations. The eyes of the world are upon us, and we must work on an agreement that really allows us to improve the implementation of the Convention as the basis for the search for formulas for a fair approach to Climate Change. It is not just about what to do, but how to do it in a way that responds to common but differentiated responsibilities and does not deepen the inequities that affect countries and social groups. We need a fair and strong agreement, which establishes clear commitments for those responsible for history and means of implementation for climate actions in developing countries in the context of sustainable development, without compromising our priorities, in particular the eradication of poverty and our right to development. A party-driven process is much more than a name and the application of a few formal rules. A process guided by the parties depends on the respect among its members and the reliability and impartiality of its institutions. The presentation of an unbalanced document that excludes the positions of developing countries generates a deep wound in this process. It would seem that norms are used to exclude the weakest, rhetoric to hide truths, the art of the word to confuse. We must remember that this process has produced throughout our negotiations many texts that cannot be ignored and that we are not starting from scratch, we are building an agreement that must be firmly aligned with our Convention, its objective, its principles and provisions. We ALBA countries support the call that Bolivia made for the Second Summit of the Peoples on Climate Change because only the people saved the people, and we consider important the approaches that took place in the celebration of this significant conference for the debates that it is having place in the framework of the Convention on the occasion of the negotiation of the Paris agreement. Likewise, we consider it important that participation spaces are considered for the representatives of the different social movements of the world so that their voices and ideas can have a place in this initiative for the salvation of life on the Planet. These are the ten actions in defense of life and against the climate crisis resulting from Tiquipaya: TEN ACTIONS IN DEFENSE OF LIFE AND AGAINST CLIMATE CRISIS Adopt a new civilizational model in the world, without consumerism, war and commercialism, a world without capitalism that is the main cause of the climate crisis and poverty; launching decolonizing and depatriarcalizing processes and recognizing Living Well as the true alternative to the global crisis of the capitalist system. Strengthen the consciousness, vision and unity of peoples, and universal citizenship, building a plural world with inter-scientific, intercultural, inter-religious and inter-spiritual dialogue. We all form a \\x1ccommon family\\x1d, we defend \\x1cthe common house\\x1d and we are children of a single \\x1ccommon mother\\x1d, Mother Earth. Defend the universal commons: the seas and oceans, water, access to atmospheric space, life and communication technologies, as rights of all those raised by Mother Earth, promoting access and participation of peoples in the use of the common heritage. Put climate sciences at the service of all living beings and Mother Earth, strengthening the development of holistic and integral approaches that incorporate the knowledge, practices, knowledge and visions of the sciences of the western world and the ancestral and cultural sciences, creating spaces for dialogue and inter-scientific action. Allocate the resources of the military machinery of all the countries that promote war, to finance the actions of the peoples against the climate crisis. Form a Permanent International Platform of the peoples of the world, where the struggles for Mother Earth and their rights come together, invigorating the communal and community energy. Demand that the countries of the world assume their responsibility with our sacred Mother Earth, guaranteeing that they comply with their international commitments and obligations so as not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius on the planet, through a carbon budget. To do this, we must establish the International Tribunal for Climate Justice and Mother Earth with full participation and representation of the peoples. Eliminate the debts of developing countries to eradicate poverty and hunger, because debts are mechanisms of domination and oppression that through international financial usury profit with misery, particularly those debts that have attacked the common heritage of the peoples. Countries must strengthen mutual agreements of complementarity and solidarity and not of enslaving indebtedness. Mother Earth is dying.

Co-Chairs, We join with other groups in refraining from reading our full statement which will be submitted for posting on the UNFCCC website. However, Co-Chairs, there is one matter that we wish to draw the attention of all delegates to. This is the injustice done to the Member States of the AOSIS by the cochairs?? text. This injustice cannot go unanswered. The small island developing states, whom I represent, do not accept the cochairs?? unabashed attempt to write SIDS out of being recognised as being particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.

              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the honor to speak on behalf of Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC). We fully associate ourselves with the statement of the Group of 77 and China. Co-Chairs, We are deeply concerned with the slow pace of negotiations given the limited amount of negotiating time left before COP21 in Paris. In this regard, we appreciate the co-chairs\\' efforts in preparing the non-papers on \\x18Draft Agreement and Decision\\' and Workstream 2 draft decision as well as the scenario note of this session. However, we are very disappointed to find that the non-papers prepared by the co-chairs is inequitable and lacks balance. In particular, the non-papers departs or dilutes the principles and provisions of the Convention, and the current drafts is weakening rather than enhancing the implementation of the Convention. Both developed and developing countries are all treated in a like manner in the draft agreement, totally wiping out any notion of historical responsibilities and equity. Co-chairs, We are of the firm view that a good text containing a basis for negotiation must be comprehensive, balanced and capture the positions of Parties reflected during the negotiations without prejudging or interpreting the emergence of convergences. The documents should include clear options reflecting different views from Parties on all key issues. We also call for text-based negotiations at this session in an inclusive, open, transparent and Party-driven negotiating process. We reaffirm that the process and outcome of ADP should be guided by and be in full accordance with all principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. The 2015 agreement shall address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate?mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support. An ambitious outcome of the ADP should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner. We reiterate that commitments under the agreement must be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. We believe that ambition and effectiveness will be achieved by maintaining differentiation among developed and developing country Parties in each element of the agreement. This will enhance participation and efforts by all countries. With regard to the Workstream 2, the pre-2020 ambition gap shall be primarily addressed through the implementation of the 2nd commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the outcome of the Bali Action Plan. We are concerned with the inadequacy of developed countries??current commitments on emission reductions and provision of financial and technological support. We underscore the need to shift the focus of the technical examination process from the mere identification of mitigation policy options to the identification or development of instruments that support effective and con\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. This statement is made on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group, the EIG, comprising Liechtenstein, Mexico, Monaco, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. We would like to thank the Co-Chairs for the draft Agreement and draft decision that you have developed based on the views and inputs from Parties. In these drafts, many issues fall short from what the EIG seeks Paris to deliver. What we need is a legally binding and enduring Agreement that will set an effective and fair basis for global climate action and that will foster cooperation and increase in ambition in light of the recommendations of latest science. To ensure such an effective global response to climate change, the EIG calls for strengthening the current drafts. Particularly, regarding the following: In the area of mitigation, we need a legal obligation by all Parties to regularly communicate nationally determined commitments/contributions. The Agreement should provide further clarity on internationally transferrable mitigation outcomes. Furthermore, we need to include provisions to ensure environmental integrity and avoid double counting in using the mitigation outcomes. In the area of adaptation, we need a legal obligation by all Parties to engage in national adaptation planning, which is also nationally determined. We need a common and robust transparency system that provides flexibility and reflects Parties differentiated capacities. Enhanced reporting will be crucial for understanding the emission developments of Parties and their progress towards the implementation of their commitments/contributions. Co-Chairs, the stocktake provisions are extremely important and they should pertain to mitigation, adaptation and support. The EIG sees room for improving the current draft so that we are regularly able to assess the aggregate progress towards the achievement of the long term goals set for this agreement in a comprehensive and balanced manner. Mr. Co-Chairs, despite the shortcomings of the drafts, the EIG welcomes them as a basis for negotiation. They reflect the views from Parties and provide room to elaborate on the areas of convergence that we have reached so far between Parties. They are a succinct and workable basis for our further negotiations. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear colleagues, we have little time remaining before Paris. However, it is sufficient if we all engage in a constructive and solution oriented manner. The EIG is ready to find an effective and ambitious agreement and is ready to engage in meaningful negotiations in order to achieve significant progress in this session. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. We thank the co-Chairs for the bold step they have taken in responding to calls to produce a text that is concise, clear and coherent. We particularly welcome the structure of the text, and the way in which key issues relating to mitigation, adaptation and finance have been disaggregated. It is vital that we retain the progress we have made in this regard. We also welcome the progress the co-Chairs have made in producing a draft decision on action before 2020, especially in relation to mitigation ambition. Nevertheless we consider that the text is unnecessarily minimalist in its approach in relation to some key issues. The text does not give enough understanding of how the different elements of the agreement will work together to raise ambition and enable all parties to act, it is a question of coherence and effectiveness. In particular, the long term temperature goal is not clearly operationalized. The whole time-line guiding presentation and formalisation of successive commitments is extremely vague. In relation to mitigation dynamism, the global stocktake is poorly described - including how it relates to the updating of subsequent nationally determined mitigation commitments, how it relates to the long term goal of staying well below 2?C. The transparency & accountability section lacks essential elements; has only a placeholder for the role of expert review teams and only sets out a poorly defined work programme. We will be looking during the course of the week to strengthen both the Agreement text and decisions to address these and other concerns. We have heard and understand that many Parties do not find their essential negotiating positions in the non-paper. We acknowledge similar and different criticisms from other Parties in relation to the text. The non-paper is nevertheless the first time on the long road from Durban that we have text that is beginning to look like a Protocol, that has a clear agreeable structure, that is short and clear and that is capable of being negotiated. Only by all Parties engaging will we be able to ensure the text is complete. While we may not agree on substance on some issues, all Parties should have the opportunity to articulate their concerns based on the text with a view to clearly setting out options for Ministerial input where we cannot agree as negotiators. With only 5 negotiating days left before Paris, we must complete that task this week in Bonn. As we agreed yesterday in the consultations with the co- presidents, we should raise now the essential elements that we all must find in this draft to be able to make rapid progress in the coming days so that we can leave Bonn with a concise and well-structured text that avoids duplication and can be a good basis for reaching agreement in Paris. Finally we applaud all those Parties that have come forward with their INDCs. There are 150 INDCs from all regions, representing a coverage of almost 90% of global emissions, much more than in the past. These INDCs are much more than just numbers. The unprecedented level of engagement they represent will lead to real and significant transformation. They also represent an extraordinary effort on the level of domestic political engagement. We need to pause and acknowledge that without those INDCs, when implemented, the temperature rise would be much higher. However, the Paris Agreement needs to ensure that we do much more, and that acti\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We meet here at the last ADP inter-sessional meeting before Paris determined to build a firm base for a successful outcome in Paris. As we have observed and emphasized many times before, developing countries are most seriously affected by the impacts of climate change and we face ever more frequent extreme weather events caused by climate change. Developing countries are responding to the challenge of climate change, as is demonstrated by the submission of ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in both mitigation and adaptation by so many developing countries, as well as by the results achieved by these countries on reducing significantly greenhouse gas emissions in the pre-2020 period. This shows the willingness to address climate change, despite not being legally obliged to do so and in many instances without the finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support by developed countries that has been agreed through this process. Co-Chairs I wish to confirm the Group\\x19s commitment to work in a disciplined and constructive manner so that we can successfully fulfil our mandate from Durban by the end of this year. In this regard, the Group wishes to acknowledge the work that you have done inter-sessionally in preparing the Non-Papers containing a draft agreement and draft decisions, including on pre-2020 ambition. The Group also welcomes the Co-Chairs\\x19 willingness to listen to the Group\\x19s views on the unacceptability of the Non-Papers as the basis for negotiations. We are pleased with the constructive and solution- oriented discussion we had with you bilaterally and with other Parties during your meeting with Heads of Delegations yesterday. As explained during those engagements, the Group of 77 and China is concerned that the text seems to attempt to rewrite, reinterpret and replace the Convention. It is extremely unbalanced and lopsided, to the extent that it jeopardizes the interests and positions of developing countries. We therefore concluded that the mandate given to the Co- Chairs was not fulfilled. It is therefore a reassuring sign that our negotiating partners have heard our concerns and that we could agree to a pragmatic solution that would ensure that we are able to move forward to the real textual negotiation with urgency. We wish to note that now, more than ever, we need clarity on the mode of work to avoid further delays due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of mandates. We emphasize once again that the purpose of the outcome in Paris is to enhance the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, not to create a new regime or rewrite, replace, renegotiate or reinterpret the Convention. It shall be under the Convention and in full accordance with its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It shall address the core elements mandated by the Durban Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures in a comprehensive and balanced manner, both in the agreement and in the COP decisions. It is crucial that adaptation and mitigation receive the same priority. This must be supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building on a scale that matches the level of action required to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 and Article 4 of the Convention. We once again urge developed countries to provide enhanced finance, technology development and transfer and capacity- building support to developing countries for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions. In doing so, the principles and provisions of the Convention must be reflected in the elements of the agreement. On Workstream II, it is essential that the work on pre-2020 ambition be treated in a balanced manner with Workstream I. The Group emphasizes that addressing the pre-2020 ambition gap is vitally important to a successful outcome of the Paris COP and will lay a solid foundation for enhanced mitigation and adaptation action post-2020.

              "       '\"Mr. Co\\x10Chairs: I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Member States of the Central American Integration System (SICA) \\x13 Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and my country, El Salvador. We would like to associate ourselves with the statement made by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Mr. Co\\x10Chairs, the member states of the SICA are strongly committed to the establishment of a new agreement to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention. But we want to be emphatic that this must be negotiated and agreed upon under the Convention and in the faithful respect and compliance to their principles and provisions. These principles and provisions, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, must appear explicitly and effectively applied in all operational items of the new agreement and not be simply referred to as a mere formality in the preambular section. We shouldn\\x19t be forced to reiterate this time and again. The repeated calls for international cooperation appearing on the substantive articles of the implementation of the draft agreement proposed by you, Co-Chairs, especially articles in 3 to 8 of this draft, we can only understand and support under the purpose of reinforcing the implementation of the Convention in the context of its principles and provisions. Under any other interpretation such appeals in the draft agreement only would dilute the Convention, and eventually would lead to weaken the effective fulfillment of their ultimate goal. Misters Co-Chairs, there is nobody who does not recognize nowadays the crucial importance of the mitigation in this phase of increasing impacts and of disastrous losses and damages associated with the climate change. That\\'s why we insist that in the new agreement it must be recognized and be established explicitly the importance that developed countries assumes the lead which corresponds to them in terms of mitigation, as set out in the Convention and in the context of their historical responsibilities. Nevertheless, we cannot be wrong adopting a new agreement that prioritizes mitigation over the adaptation and the necessary means of implementation, without granting to them parity of political and legal importance. The commitments must not be exclusive for mitigation, while leaving open to the will of the international cooperation and solidarity the needs for adaptation, financing, development and technology transfer and capacity building. It cannot be expected to strengthen the climate action by only increasing the burdens on developing countries without the provision of the appropriate means of implementation for the efforts to be fair, equitable and in the required scale. Mr. Co-Chairs, adaptation is the top priority for developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, among which are the members of the SICA. In the new Agreement should be recognized that the greatest efforts of these countries, which in addition are very low emitters of GHG, should be directed to reduce vulnerability, to strengthen the adaptation and thus minimize the impacts and losses and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. In particular, the agriculture, food production and food security constitute inalienable adaptation priorities for our countries. There is already a huge and growing gap in adaptation and this must be properly recognized and managed in the new agreement. To do this, under the new agreement, Developed country parties shall communicate periodically their clear commitments and predictable funding for adaptation, at least of the same level as the intended for mitigation. The new agreement shall specify support to adaptation actions in the territories, in addition of support to the experiences and knowledge sharing processes. Although adaptation remains our priority, the SICA countries have launched plans, policies and development programmes which strongly drive the mitigation effort. These actions are consistent with our repeated call to all the parties for the new agreement to undertake as a goal to limit the increase in global average temperature to less than 1.5 degrees centigrade above the existing in the preindustrial era. The new agreement cannot ignore the scale of the current impacts of climate change nor the warnings on which, in this sense, multiple specializing investigations are converging. Also, losses and damages associated with the adverse effects of climate change are already exceeding the public finance capabilities of our countries, as well as in many others particularly vulnerable to climate change. The new agreement must set out the adequate and specific provisions to meet the needs associated with this problem, including migration and climate displaced peoples and communities, non economic losses and other effects associated with slow on set events. Mr. Co-chairs, we all, including the incoming presidency of the Conference of the Parties, agree that climate finance, additional, adequate and predictable is crucial to the adoption of an agreement truly ambitious and effective; and we welcome the fact that in article 5 of the draft agreement proposed by you, reaffirm the leadership that corresponds in this matter to developed \"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to deliver this statement on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. In this last formal negotiating session before Paris, we need to keep an urgent focus on developing a text for a new agreement that is globally applicable, ambitious, legally binding and sets a credible and durable strategy for tackling climate change over coming decades. Co-Chairs, at the last ADP session the Parties asked you to assist us in this task. We thank you and welcome your efforts to produce a much more concise, focused and readable input for our work. This is, as we discussed, a step change that we needed. That said, we would be clear that as it stands, there are provisions in this non-paper that we have serious concerns with ? there are some provisions that cross redlines, and others that we think are not sufficient to deliver the ambitious and durable outcome we want. The text offers slim outcomes on progressively building global mitigation efforts, accountability and transparency ? components which will be critical to the quality of a Paris deal. We welcome the steps that have been taken to raise the profile of adaptation and climate resilience. We also recognise that financing and support will be an integral part of the Paris outcome. But further work will be needed to find workable landing zones and appropriate solutions with regard to issues such as finance and loss and damage. We also need to have a clear conception of the ongoing work program, associated timeframes and procedures that will be required to prepare for implementing the agreement. Umbrella Group countries are prepared to get straight into negotiations with all our colleagues to see where we can clarify and improve the contents of the agreement and decision. In doing so, we will need to stay focused on drawing out convergences and working on landing zones, as well as keeping in mind what is and isn??t politically and practically feasible. We believe this was the spirit in which the non-paper was prepared. We continue to welcome your guidance, Co-Chairs, in steering this process and reflecting the outcomes of the session. The non-paper also captures the broad support for a decision on enhancing mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 period. There is still work to be done in workstream 2 on improving the technical examination process and how best to improve engagement with relevant Convention bodies and non-state actors. We look forward to considering how this work can be taken forward after the conclusion of the ADP. Finally, we are pleased to welcome the large number of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions that have been submitted. Every Umbrella Group country has submitted its INDC, and we congratulate all others that have done so. We continue to encourage those yet to submit to bring forward iNDCs as soon as possible. \"',\n",

The Group wishes to thank you and our Co-Facilitators for your hard work during this week. We believe that, despite the initial difficulties, Parties managed to make progress during this session. Above all, the process and the outcome of this session are now fully Party-owned. In particular, we wish to thank you for the compilation paper containing a draft agreement and decisions on Workstream I and II, which were issued earlier this afternoon. The Group believes that this new text is balanced and reflective of the work done this week. As such this text can constitute a basis and a starting point for negotiations during the next session. It is important that the integrity of this text is maintained. In order to enhance this text, we suggest that it would be useful to request the Secretariat to prepare a technical paper, which should identify closely related paragraphs and duplications within sections, and possible areas for streamlining. This should only be an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing the content of the text. Regarding the draft decision that accompanies the agreement, we note that different approaches were followed in the Spin-Off Groups with respect to the different parts of the decision text. Unfortunately the Parties did not manage to have a complete reading of the decision text and a footnote could be included to note this situation and to ensure that the discussion of the text in question will be without prejudice to Parties?? positions. In light of the fact that the decisions still need considerable attention of the Parties, more time needs to be allocated for the discussions on the draft decisions for Workstream I and Workstream II. The Group of 77 and China also request that future sessions be open to observers to ensure that we all are accountable to our civi\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co Chairs. Fellow delegates. I have the honour to submit this statement on behalf of the AILAC group of countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama?, Paraguay, Peru and our most recent member, whom we welcome in this COP21, Honduras. At the outset, AILAC associates its statement with the statement submitted by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The adoption of the Paris Agreement is not in the horizon anymore. It is imminent now that we are finally here at CoP 21 at last. Many efforts by all, have been made to get us here, and it is now time to move beyond mere assurances that our positions are reflected in the text, and provide for the compromise and bridging to happen with all of our partners to ensure that the ADP delivers to the CoP by next Saturday, that which it was mandated to deliver: a legally binding instrument, under the Convention, applicable to all, that addresses effectively and in a balanced manner mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and transparency. The Paris Agreement must be durable and set the basis for enhancing ambition towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention, by means of implementing nationally determined commitments in a successive and progressive manner, with a view to arrive at commonly agreed goals on all elements: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The number of issues, concerns and the scale of the task, have put us in a situation where we have the challenge of condensing the complex text before us into a comprehensive, manageable, balanced output, ready for consideration of our Ministers by next Saturday. This calls for us to shift gears, and a monumental effort to focus our discussions into finding concrete solutions and common ground, and very few options per issue. Bearing this in mind, we support and very much hope that the modality of work set out by you in your scenario note, will allow us to achieve that purpose, and encourage all of our partners to keep focus on the more substantive aspects of our work without delay. Co\\x10chairs, Distinguished colleagues The outcome of the ADP, the Agreement we adopt here at CoP 21, is the ultimate opportunity we have to prove the worth of the multilateral system to be the most transparent, inclusive and balanced setting to address a challenge of global dimensions such as climate change, its causes and catastrophic effects, that affects unjustly, the world\\x19s most vulnerable population, an important part of which is found in AILAC countries. The system embedded in the Paris Agreement, must set out a clear direction of travel, with collectively agreed ambitious targets built around the 1.5?C long term temperature goal, which in turn must and shall be met by comprehensive ambitious and successive nationally determined commitments that deliver upon those targets, with developed country parties taking the lead. The Agreement must recognize and provide legal force to the actions that Parties have nationally determined and communicated, acknowledging both the capabilities and responsibilities of developed and developing countries respectively, as well as the need for action on behalf of all Parties to deliver on the necessary collective level of ambition. For AILAC, this collective commitment makes it imperative to reflect a long?term mitigation target aimed at net zero emissions by the end of the century and, consequently the effective implementation of mitigation commitments and provision of finance. A strengthened transparency system together with successive commitments on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation are necessary to ensure the progressive increase of ambition every five years. Parity must be achieved between adaptation and mitigation in the Agreement, supported by a real commitment on behalf of developed countries to provide resources on a global scale for mitigation and adaptation in a predictable, sustainable and appropriate manner. Mobilizing climate finance is crucial, not only \"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co-Chairs, Excellencies, Colleagues, The Maldives has the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, a coalition of 44 coastal and low-lying islands states that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Let me begin by thanking you for your hard work over the course of the year. We have accomplished much together and we look forward to completing our journey here with a fair and effective agreement that meets the interests of all parties. Co-Chairs, At nearly every meeting this year, since we first gathered in Geneva, these negotiations have opened in the aftermath of record and sometimes deadly extreme weather events around the world. Our membership has been struck by deadly typhoons in the Pacific, Hurricanes in the Caribbean, record tides and floods off the coast of Africa and in the Indian Ocean. Climate change is here and it is getting worse. What\\x19s more, the latest science confirms what we are seeing with our own eyes: The World Meteorological Organization reports that 2011-2015 has been the warmest five-year period on record and this year is on track to be the hottest ever. It also found that in 2014, sea level rise accelerated (3 millimeters) per year on average worldwide. This is around double the average annual rise of 1.6 mm in the 20th century. Co-Chairs, We must always be mindful that the principles and provisions of the Convention are the bedrock of our work and must be honored if we are to reach agreement on issues that have life and death consequences for our members. The Convention explicitly recognizes the particular needs and vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States and the new agreement must maintain this status in order to ensure our protection. Co-Chairs, For AOSIS, the Paris Agreement must be a balanced package that includes meaningful outcomes on all of the pillars of our mandate from Durban - mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity-building ? as well as loss and damage as a separate and distinct issue. In particular, we emphasise the following priorities: First, the Paris Agreement must establish medium and long-term emission reduction pathways that are capable of delivering a limitation of temperature increases consistent with this below 1.5-degree goal. The Agreement must demand ambitious performance from Parties through internationally legally binding, quantified mitigation commitments that increase global ambition over successive commitment cycles. Second, in terms of finance, tackling climate change and adapting to its impacts will require significantly scaled-up, new, additional and predictable financial resources, starting from a base of $100 billion USD per year by 2020, with provisions to enhance SIDS access especially to public, grant-based support for adaptation, given our unique challenges and the existential threat that climate change poses to us. Third, AOSIS welcomes the treatment of Loss and Damage as a standalone article in the draft agreement, particularly since it was not initially referenced. However, it must be articulated in an actionable form. Parties should recognise the need to address Loss and Damage associated with climate change and establish a process or system that is actually capable of doing so. In this regard, the approach proposed by the G77 and China accomplishes these objectives. AOSIS emphasises the role of the Convention in promoting the implementation of approaches to address Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, which should include, inter alia: Enhancing knowledge and understanding of comprehensive risk management approaches to address Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including slow onset impacts; Strengthening dialogue, coordination, coherence and synergies among relevant stakeholders; Enhancing action and support, including finance, technology and capacity- building, to address Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. We look forward to engaging with Parties on this critical issue in the same spirit of the progress that we have made, thus far. Finally, avoiding the worst impacts of climate change requires us to rapidly scale up and implement solutions in the near term. We believe Workstream 2 under the ADP, which focuses on pre-2020 ambition, has already produced a useful set of good practices and policy options for ramping up ambition. The Paris agreement should include a decision that strengthens the ongoing efforts to scale up voluntary multilateral and multi-?stakeholder cooperation under Workstream 2. In particular, the link between the technical and political levels should be improved, so AOSIS has called for the appointment of two high-level champions, supported by an expert team, to provide overall political guidance to the line of discussions. Workstream 2 is not an academic exercise. It must be about implementation. This meeting must be a turning point - our generation??s last best opportunity to meet the climate change challenge and accelerate the urgent transition to resilient, low-carbo\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India and China). We fully associate ourselves with the statement of the Group of 77 and China. Co-chairs, Given the limited amount of negotiation time, the BASIC countries commit to work with you and all other parties in a constructive spirit to advance the pace of negotiation in a fully party-driven manner to reach an equitable, ambitious, comprehensive and balanced agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that enhances the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention. We reaffirm that the process and outcome of ADP should be guided by and be in full accordance with all principles and provisions of the UNFCCC. The Paris agreement shall address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate ? mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support. An ambitious outcome of the ADP should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner. We reiterate that commitments under the agreement must be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. We believe that ambition and effectiveness will be achieved by maintaining differentiation among developed and developing country Parties in each element of the agreement. This will enhance participation and efforts by all countries. We emphasize the importance of holding the increase in average global temperature below 2?C related to pre-industrial levels, through enhanced mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation for both. We affirm that the Paris agreement should provide for Parties to regularly prepare, communicate and implement their enhanced commitments and actions in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention. Contributions should be nationally determined and comprehensive, covering mitigation, adaptation and provision of support by developed countries to developing countries. We reiterate that developed countries must continue to take the lead in the post-2020 period, by committing and implementing ambitious, economy-wide, absolute quantified emission reduction targets, while developing countries will enhance their different types of mitigation efforts. We underscore the equal importance of adaptation and mitigation in the agreement. The Paris agreement should ensure the provision of adequate international support to developing countries, based on their needs and costs of adaptation. We emphasize that developed countries must provide financial resources, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries for their ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions under the Paris agreement, in order to progressively and substantially scale up their support in the post-2020 period, with USD 100 billion per year as a starting point. Public financial resources, distinct from ODA, should be the main source and funds from the private sectors can be complementary. We underscore the need for technology development and transfer to developing countries. The Paris agreement should provide for strengthening the existing technology mechanism, with a view to promoting cooperation on research and development, demonstration and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies and know-how, in particular addressing the issue of intellectual property rights by creating a window under the Green Climate Fund (GCF). We concur that a post-2020 enhanced transparency system of action and support should be built on the existing differentiated arrangements under the Convention, while providing flexibility to developing countries. We support the establishment of a global stocktaking of the overall implementation of the Paris agreement and progress towards achieving the objective of the Convention and the global temperature goal. The stocktaking should cover mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation in a comprehensive manner. With regard to the Workstream 2, we note with concern that pre-2020 ambition gaps exist not only in mitigation, but also in adaptation, finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. We highlight the need for increasing pre-2020 ambition by developed countries to build trust amongst Parties. We call for a strong, comprehensive and meaningful decision on pre-2020 ambition in Paris with a view to laying a solid foundation for post-2020 enhanced action. We urge those developed countries who have made pledges to the GCF to sign contribution agreements or arrangements as a matter of urgency. We also call on those developed countries to increase their contributions to the GCF. We f\"',\n",
              "       '\"Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs, Panama has the honour to speak on behalf of the 52 countries of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, of which the following have endorsed this statement: Bangladesh, Belize, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d\\x19Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Honduras, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Congo, Solomon Islands, Suriname, Togo, Uganda, Vanuatu and Zimbabwe. Mr. Co-chairs, at the outset we support the statement made by the distinguished delegate from South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Our Coalition welcomes the progress achieved during the most recent negotiating sessions and the mode of work you proposed for this first week here in Paris. Mr. Co-chairs, the 2015 agreement must respond to science and therefore include ambitious and scaled up commitments by all Parties in accordance with the principle of the Convention, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. In order to meet the 1.5?C scenario target, every Party must be encouraged to aggressively engage and scale up actions. The mitigation gap cannot be closed and the long term goal cannot be achieved without the contribution of REDD Plus. For the majority of developing countries and for around 2 billion people dependent on forests, this requires REDD+ to be clearly identified in the agreement as key element in the fight against global climate change. Moreover, the REDD+ mechanism must be established by the 2015 agreement so that the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ and all REDD+ related decisions are anchored permanently in the new climate treaty. The REDD+ mechanism will be based on existing methodologies and guidelines in line with the IPCC standards so as to ensure environmental integrity. For many developing countries, success will be based on the mobilization of predictable, accessible, sustained and scaled-up financia\"',\n",
              "       '\"Dear Co-Chairs, Distinguished Colleagues, Dear Friends, This statement is made on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. Since Durban, we have made a lot of progress towards the agreement all of us need to ensure the future on this planet is safeguarded. The political determination has never been as high. We know urgent action is imperative and recognize our responsibility to future generations. We are now in the last few days to work on the text we will present to ministers at the end of this week. We must use these days wisely, in a spirit of compromise, to be able to bring forward a text for the legally binding agreement applicable to all, and the decisions, that are concise, clear and coherent, with a limited number of political questions left open for ministers. We support the Co-Chair\\x19s scenario note as proposed, and suggest that their facilitators should have the flexibility to encourage informal work between groups of Parties to reach resolution on key issues. As our hosts stated on Saturday - with ownership comes responsibility! The Contact Group should be used to address cross-cutting issues and those issues not allocated to spin-offs and be able to concretely address issues throughout the week. The agreement must be ambitious, it must allow us to get on track for a world that can stay well below 2?C global warming and it must move us all towards climate resilience. It must also be fair, effective, and durable, putting our economies and societies onto a pathway that is compatible with achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention. We consider that the text needs work in particular in relation to the following key issues: The dynamic mechanism to raise ambition over time: This must include a stock take every five years that informs a process where all Parties would submit new INDCs or resubmit existing ones. The notion of progression over time is essential. We concur with others that mitigation and adaptation are equally important, but while elaborating them we have to recognise their specificities. The long term goal: the long term temperature goal of staying below 2?C global warming must be clearly operationalised to send the world a clear signal on the direction of travel all our economies and society are embarking on. A strong transparency and accountability system: to track progress of the steps forward of Parties towards achieving their targets. The INDCs need to be anchored firmly in the new legally binding Agreement. Transition to climate resilience: the agreement must help achieve development that is resilient to climate impacts. Support: the agreement needs to help mobilise support for those countries that need it, provided by those in a position to do so, to assist the implementation of action. As for many of our partners here, these are key pre-requisites for the European Union to achieve an agreement in Paris that is worth signing up to. We will be looking during the course of the next days to strengthen both the agreement text and decisions to address these and other concerns. We applaud all those Parties that have come forward with their INDCs. There are over 180 Parti\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, a group of 134 developing countries, representing about 85% of the world\\x19s population. Throughout the ADP process we have reiterated that not only do developing countries face threats to their achievement of sustainable development, but also the very existence and survival of countries, societies and the ecosystems of our Mother Earth. It is for this reason that developing countries have had no choice but to act against climate change, even in the absence of adequate finance, technology and capacity-building support by developed countries, as clearly demonstrated by the communication of INDCs by the majority of developing countries. Co-Chairs Because climate change is such a serious and urgent threat for developing countries, you can be assured that no group of countries is as committed as the G77 and China to a successful conclusion of our work under the ADP. I therefore wish to reiterate that the Group is fully committed to work in a disciplined and constructive manner. We wish to re-emphasise that the objective of the ADP is to enhance action and to promote the full and effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through the strengthening of the multilateral rules-based regime under the Convention. It is not within the ADP\\x19s mandate to replace, rewrite or reinterpret the Convention, its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. These principles and provisions of the Convention must be reflected in the elements of the agreement. The Paris outcome must address the core elements mandated by the Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures in a comprehensive and balanced manner, both in the agreement and in the COP decisions. Adaptation and mitigation must receive the same priority. This must be supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building on a scale that matches the level of action required to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 of the Convention. In this regard, we urge developed countries to provide enhanced finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions. Co-Chairs When we met in Bonn in October, much time was lost because we started with a text that was very unbalanced. Nevertheless, we believe that the text that we now have is a suitable basis to continue our negotiations. There is not much time left to conclude our work and we must therefore engage in substantive negotiations. We must be all very conscious of the fact that process will be crucially important for the success of the COP. In order to make progress, we suggest that cross-cutting and overarching issues, e.g. purpose, long-term goal, differentiation, progression, ambition and the cross cutting aspects of finance and the legal nature of different obligations across the text, be discussed in the Contact Group. As progress on these cross-cutting issues is essential to unlock the difficulties that are experienced in the Facilitation Groups dealing with mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, and final clauses, these discussions will accelerate the work in the Facilitation Groups. Postponing these important discussions in the Contact Group will not be helpful.\"',\n",
              "       '\"Co-Chairs, I have the privilege to deliver this statement on behalf of the Umbrella Group of countries. We arrive in Paris fully conscious of our responsibility to deliver a new, ambitious legal agreement that sets the world on course to avoid the dangerous impacts of climate change. This new agreement, applicable to all Parties, will be a watershed in our collective work under the UNFCCC. It is our duty to ensure the outcome is one of which we can be proud, that will cement and accelerate the changes that are already underway, as we transition to low-emissions, climate resilient societies. We are conscious of the limited time available, and wish to begin work straight away on substantive negotiations. To this end, we would propose that two spin-off groups be scheduled for Tuesday morning: one on finance and another on transparency of action and support. These issues are critical for the Paris agreement, and we think letting discussion begin on Tuesday morning will help ensure adequate time is devoted to reaching strong outcomes that can be supported by all Parties. Co-Chairs The Paris Agreement must be both ambitious and credible. It must establish a strategy to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees including through a long-term global goal, mitigation contributions from all Parties, a periodic revisit, and robust rules for transparency and accountability. It must promote action to build resilience and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, and ensure that support continues to flow. We have before us as a starting point for our final negotiations the bare materials needed to reach this outcome. Our job is to mould the draft text into a clear, concise, and focussed text that captures landing zones and clearly articulates options on key political issues for our Ministers to consider next week. This will require all Parties to strive towards compromise, and work in a focused, organised manner. Umbrella Group countries are in Paris to negotiate. We are eager to start work straight away, and work constructively with all Parties on bridging options for the agreement and decision. We have confidence in the Co- Chairs to guide Parties?? work, recognising that modes of work may vary between groups. We must also allow space for Parties to consider decision text, which will be essential to advance arrangements in preparation for the agreement??s entry into force. And there is important work to be done in workstream 2 on improving the technical examination process and promoting effective engagement with relevant Convention bodies and non- state act\"',\n",
              "       '\"Distinguished Co Chairs. Fellow delegates. I have the honour to submit this statement on behalf of the AILAC group of countries: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama\\x01, Paraguay and Peru. At the outset, AILAC associates its statement with that submitted by South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. Four years ago in Durban, at CoP 17 we affirmed our collective will to prove that the multilateral setting under the UNFCCC was the forum that could provide a comprehensive and effective response to the global threat of climate change. The instrument to deliver this response: a new legally binding agreement, under the Convention, applicable to all, to set us on track, as a global community, towards the common target of holding the increase in the average temperature below 2?C or 1.5?C, and achieve a world without harmful emissions. Never before, have we been so close on delivering an ambitious outcome, which rises to the magnitude of this challenge. Never before have we moved so decisively in at attempt to bridge our interests, concerns and challenges into a single comprehensive course of action that delivers ambition on mitigation, adaptation and the associated means of implementation. Here in Paris, we have a unique opportunity to secure the future of generations to come. We must be able these coming 3 days, to move beyond national positions, to a solution cognisant of our collective interest of prosperity for people and planet, and beyond our national agendas or divergences. We cannot and we must not allow self-interest to deter us from doing what we know is right. CoP 21 is the place and the moment for a new chapter in the fight against climate change, one that delivers unequivocally on the mandate of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. The Paris Agreement must be durable and set the basis for enhancing ambition towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention, by enabling the implementation of nationally determined commitments in a successive, progressive, and fully transparent manner, with a view to arrive at commonly agreed goals on all elements: mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The Agreement must recognize and provide legal force to the actions that Parties themselves have nationally determined and communicated, acknowledging both the capabilities and responsibilities of developed and developing countries respectively, as well as the need for action to deliver on the necessary collective level of ambition. For AILAC, this collective calling makes it imperative to reflect a long-term mitigation goal that leads the world towards net zero emissions by the end of the century and, consequently the effective implementation of individual mitigation commitments and provision of finance to support developing countries to reach these. A strengthened transparency system, together with successively updated commitments on mitigation and means of implementation, are necessary to ensure the integrity of the agreement, promote trust between Parties and facilitate the progressive increase of ambition every five years. The Agreement must also provide parity between adaptation and mitigation, supported by a real commitment by developed countries to provide resources in a transparent and predictable manner, in particular through the definition of clear collective and regularly updated short term targets and the communication of individual quantified forward- looking information. An equitable and fair agreement must include Loss and Damage, a reality this is affecting countries and will continue permanently. Therefore, Loss and Damage must be adequately recognized and reflected in the agreement, including various institutional arrangements necessary to fully address the gravity of the issue. Let us also not forget that along with the agreeing an durable agreement that will facilitate enhanced ambition from post 2020 into future decades, Paris must also fortify and crystalize efforts by Parties and Non-Party stakeholders to increase ambitious action pre 2020, in order to close the dangerous emissions gap that continues to exist, threatening the continued development and sustainability and development of all countries. As we approach the end of this long journey from Durban to Paris, AILAC commends the efforts and recognizes the key role that many partners have had in bringing us to this important moment of our process. One of our own, Peru - as President of CoP 20 ? kept us moving forward on the road from Lima to Paris, always reminding us of the importance of unity and persistence towards our common objective. Five years ago, another regional partner, Mexico, as President of CoP 16 reminded us of the importance of trust, trust in each other and trust in the foundations laid 20 years ago under the Convention, as the enduring framework that can serve to catalyse global action, while recognizing our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. We now bestow our complete confidence in France, as the President of CoP 21, who has shown commitment to an inclusive road to Paris and who we trust will continue to preserve and pursue the important values of transparency, inclusiveness and party-driven nature of this process, which are critical to the success and endurance of the multilateral system. Because only if we all feel a part to this deal will we be able to tackle this problem once and for all. We have learned from the mistakes of the past, which will help us succeed here in Paris and beyond.

Our Coalition wishes to thank the Co-Chairs, the facilitators and the secretariat for their hard work. We deeply appreciate your tireless efforts and we believe the ADP has successfully completed its task. At the same time, we also would like to thank and support the effort of the French Presidency in the run-up to Paris and in particular in these days here at COP21. As usual, you can count on our group and our support. Mr. Co-chair, on Monday at the beginning of COP21, more than 60 heads of state and government clearly emphasized in their speeches the importance and the critical role of forest in the fight against climate change. Combating deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ and the respect for biodiversity were among the key terms utilized in more than 60 high-level speeches. Mr. co-chair, that is a strong political signal and we have been mandated to deliver. Therefore Mr. co-chair, a REDD+ Mechanism must be reflected in the agreement, based fully on those relevant decisions ALREADY agreed by the COP. Mr. Co-Chairs, our Coalition is prepared to work hard and constructively with you and all Parties in these final days with the view to achieve an historical outcome for future generations. Thank you Mr. Co-Chairs. \"',\n",

The EIG would like to thank you, Mr. Co-Chairs, and all colleagues for the leadership and hard work. We think that we did make substantial progress over the last week. We were able to produce a text, which is much shorter and clearer than the text with which we began our work. The text, as it is, clearly contains the agreement, which we are going to adopt next week. It contains its elements, but it also reflects the important political decisions that we still have to resolve. It is a good basis for our further work. Let me highlight that in contrast to the COP 15 in Copenhagen, we do have a strong basis for our negotiations developed by all parties together. Mr. Co-Chairs, dear colleagues, the EIG is confident that we will be able to solve the open issues over the next days. The EIG is ready to work together with all of you over the next days in an open-ended, open-minded, solution oriented, ambitious and pragmatic, and cooperative manner to achieve what we all want and what we all need: a strong, durable and dynamic, legally binding agreement engaging all for the period post 2020. \"',\n",

We are very grateful for these tireless efforts throughout the duration of the ADP. The ADP has been engaged in sensitive and complex negotiations since the work was launched in Durban. The Group of 77 and China therefore welcome the progress that has been achieved. However, the output of the ADP could have taken us closer to the expected outcome in terms of the progress needed at this critical time. The Group had hoped that our work would have been further advanced at this point to put us in a position to forward a streamlined text to Ministers with clear options for political decision making. At this important point in the negotiaitons, the Group of 77 and China wish to reiterate its commitment to a fair and ambitious outcome of the ADP here in Paris on both pre-2020 ambition of actions and support, as well as the post-2020 agreement. We are ready to negotiate and work as fast as possible on the basis of the text containing the facilitators\\x19 bridging proposals. At this historic moment where all Parties will take a significant step forward in the fight against climate change, we must remain focused on what we agreed in Durban. The Group of 77 and China wish to re-emphasise its position that the Paris outcome must be under the Convention and in accordance with its principles and provisions and must not rewrite or reinterpret the Convention. The core elements mandated by the Durban Durban decision (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building and transparency of action and support), as well as loss and damage and response measures must be addressed in a comprehensive and balanced manner, both in the agreement and in the COP decisions. Adaptation and mitigation must receive the same priority. These must be supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building on a scale that matches the level of action required to achieve the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 of the Convention. We believe that we have come a long way and we have a text to take forward for further work by the COP. We realise however that much more work needs to be done in the next week to fulfil the mandate from Durban. As we prepare ourselves for the task that lies ahead next week, we should be reminded of the words of Nelson Mandela, who passed away two years ago on this day, that ??it always seems impossible until it??s done??.

Together, we have generated a text that holds within it the opportunity to conclude an ambitious and credible Paris Agreement that can establish a strategy to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees. This text reflects Parties options. We believe that all have engaged actively and constructively this week to express these options with as much clarity and conciseness as possible. Progress has not been as fast as we might have liked, but we can only take the next step, to develop real bridging proposals and landing zones, together. We thank you sincerely, co-chairs as well as your predecessors, and your co-facilitators for your leadership, that has guided us this far. We also express our support for the Presidency to guide negotiations next week in a way that continues to be transparent, party-driven and sees Ministers to engage effectively and provide the political guidance needed to unlock agreement. This process must allow us to deliver an ambitious agreement. Umbrella Group countries see this as one that sets: -  A long-term global goal to guide our collective efforts -  A commitment from all Parties to take on nationally determined mitigation contributions -  A periodic, harmonised process to revise contributions and build ambition -  Robust transparency and accountability rules that build trust and promote effective implementation -  And arrangements that promote adaptation and resilience, and that ensure finance, technology and capacity building support continues to flow to those Parties who need it. Let us be clear, we will not accept a minimalist outcome that leaves all the details to be decided after Paris. We need ambition and clarity, here and now. An ambitious outcome also means finding ways to reflect differentiation that are consistent with modern day realities, and incentivise all Parties to contribute to this global effort. We cannot get where we need to go, by doing what we have always done. As developed countries, we will continue to lead. But others with high capacity must join us. And all countries should progress in the same direction over time. We are also committed to an outcome on workstream 2 that incentivises greater emissions cuts to 2020 by creating a space to explore practical, real-world action, and bring together the people who make it happen. Umbrella Group countries stand ready to work with all Parties, and to offer our full support to the French Presidency to deliver an historic outcome here in Paris. Thank you. \"'],\n",

              "'\"distinguished co-chairs, excellencies, colleagues nauru has the honour to speak on behalf of the alliance of small island states, a group of 44 countries that are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. aosis associates itself. co-chairs, at the outset, let me also thank you for your leadership during this phase of the negotiations. you have set the stage for us to make essential progress this week and beyond. i assure you of our continued support and constructive engagement as we work expeditiously to close the emissions gap and fulfill other commitments laid out in the durban agreement. the time we have to act, it cannot be said enough, is rapidly slipping away for the members of the group of countries that i represent. scientists have warned that unless urgent and dramatic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next few years, well before 2020, i repeat, well before 2020, the opportunity to avoid catastrophic global warming in excess of 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels - to say nothing of the below 1.5 degree threshold supported by over 100 countries in this room - could be irrevocably lost. the perilous circumstances we face were underscored last week when researchers at the mauna loa laboratory confirmed that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are on track to, this month, exceed 400 parts per million for sustained lengths of time throughout much of the northern hemisphere. this ominous milestone is particularly unsettling for the citizens of small island and low-lying coastal states who have already experienced life-altering changes due to warming of less than one-degree celsius, including stronger and more deadly tropical cyclones, prolonged droughts, the loss of mangrove habitat, and, perhaps most alarmingly, an acceleration in sea level rise. what\\'s more, we know that coral reefs, which support many of our economies, and buffer us climate-related extreme weather events, are likely to stop growing if the 450-ppm mark is passed and start dissolving at concentrations beyond 550 ppm as ocean acidification intensifies. in light of these harsh realities, we must achieve an adp agreement that ultimately brings co2 concentrations back below these levels to limit warming below 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. co-chairs, it is in this context that aosis wants to emphasize- as we have done in our formal adp submissions- that our work this week and in june must focus intensely on delivering concrete outcomes for the climate that sustains us all. we have no other formal process to address our concerns except this multilateral process and therefore failure for us is a direct threat to our very existence. with a view to giving this focus to our work, we have all agreed to organize our discussions into two separate workstreams - workstrearm 2 is tasked with identifying ways to raise mitigation ambition in the pre-2020 timeframe and workstrearm 1 with elaborating the details of a protocol to be adopted by 2015 at the latest. work in both workstrearms must be driven by a sense of urgency, bearing in mind that our failure to act decisively now will require a reactive and vastly more expensive response later. moreover, a failure to close the pre-2020 initigation ambition gap will have profound implications for the scale and nature of obligations under the 2015 protocol. but despite these linkages, the discussions for both workstreams must remain separate. in this context, we reiterate our call for two distinct contact groups to ensure that the subject matter for the two workstreatns is kept separate. in terms of workstream 2, we need to use our two sessions in bonn to focus closely on specific and scalable mitigation actions and policies that can be deployed immediately, including those outlined in the unep gap report, and also look at strategies for overcoming implementation barriers, including the scaled up delivery of financial resources, technology and capacity building. we welcome the roundtables proposed by the co-chairs, but will want to bring more focus to our work as the year proceeds. at the same time, we must expand the conversation beyond purely climate negotiators and work to engage those with on-the-ground expertise in the development and implementation of successful mitigation actions in this process-civil society, scientists, the private sector and experts from the relevant ministries within our governments. of course, the decision to raise ambition ultimately requires engagement at the highest level, so we are calling for a ministerial meeting on raising mitigation ambition at cop19 in warsaw to help build the political momentum necessary for the adoption of more ambitious mitigation targets by developed countries and namas by developing countries. we welcomed the announcement made by the un secretary-general in doha that he will convene a leaders summit in 2014, which will serve as an important decision point for countries to raise their ambition. co-chairs, we must also make progress in workstream 1 on the core elements of the new legally binding agreement to be adopted in 2015. we know all too well that turning policy into action can be a painfully slow process, so the decisions we make today must be guided by the science, and sufficiently ambitious to protect the interests of future generations, as well as our own. our work moving forward should continue to build on the foundations of the convention, including its fundamental principles and provisions. in the view of aosis, the outcome of the process launched under the durban platform for enhanced action should be a protocol under the convention applicable to all parties, to be adopted no later than 2015, which strengthens the multilateral rules-based and legally binding regime, based on science and designed to ensure the survival of the communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. being applicable to all, it wil require universal participation and contributions from every party. as we see the alarming impacts of our past of inaction on climate change unfold before our eyes, and the very real economic, social and physical costs of this inaction grow larger, perversely, the solutions to the climate crisis are more accessible and less costly than ever before. nevertheless there is an ongoing need for financial support and technology transfer and capacity building to developing countries. this is about political will, and our mandate from durban makes it clear that this process shall raise ambition. we urge all parties to work with an increased sense of urgency this week and above all focus on doing our part to achieve all ambitious, comprehensive and meaningful outcome. thank you.\"'"
